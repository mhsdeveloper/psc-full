		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary is a publication of the Adams Papers editorial project at the Massachusetts Historical Society. The Adams Papers project was founded in 1954 to prepare a comprehensive published edition of the manuscripts written and received by the family of Abigail and John Adams of Quincy, Massachusetts. For more information on the project, including access to the multigenerational family archive and other aspects of its publication, visit <a href="https://www.masshist.org/adams_editorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adams Papers Editorial Project | Massachusetts Historical Society (masshist.org)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work on the John Quincy Adams Digital Diary began in 2016 with the goal of making Adams’ diary truly accessible for the first time by presenting a verified and searchable transcription of each diary entry alongside manuscript page images. Adams often recorded more than one version of his diary for the same date. He created full, complete entries that varied in length, “line-a-day” placeholder entries, and notes or draft-like entries he called “Rubbish.” The digital publication of his diary was thus conceived in two parts. Editors initially focused on the entries that constitute either the only or the most complete entry for any given date. Most often this meant using the full entry; however, the line-a-day or draft entries were utilized when no other version was extant. This initial work encompasses more than 75 percent of the total diary. Remaining work adds secondary versions of diary entries and incorporates entries previously published in the Adams Papers letterpress series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Materials Included and Their Arrangement</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Diaries of John Quincy Adams are printed here in their entirety in keeping with the requirements of the Adams Manuscript Trust, which donated the papers to the Massachusetts Historical Society and created the Adams Papers editorial project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Quincy Adams penned his first diary entry on 12 November 1779 when he was twelve years old. He dictated his final entry a little more than 68 years later, on 20 February 1848. The cumulative diary contains over 15,000 pages of handwritten entries by Adams within 51 manuscript volumes that are part of the Adams Family Papers manuscript collection at the Massachusetts Historical Society. “There has perhaps not been another individual of the human race of whose daily existence from early childhood to four score years has been noted down with his own hand so minutely as mine,” Adams wrote of his endeavor on 31 October 1846.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the 51 volumes, ten are gatherings of stitched, pinned, or loose sheets, some with covers; ten are printed almanacs in which diary entries were written on blank pages; and thirty are volumes of varying size bound in calf or vellum. Volume 51, which includes diary entries for 3 February – 14 November 1803, is now part of his son Charles Francis Adams’ Miscellany 15, in which the latter added notes about properties and family history. Only the volume 51 pages containing John Quincy Adams’ diary entries are presented in the Digital Diary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While John Quincy Adams remained a dedicated diarist throughout his youth and adulthood, the types of entries he penned varied. The diary consists of a combination of full entries, draft entries, and line-a-day entries. From 1 January 1795 to 6 May 1821 there is a full entry for each day. For briefer periods, each of more than a year’s duration, full entries were also made: 1 January 1785 – 23 August 1788, 1 February 1827 – 24 June 1828, 1 January 1829 – 24 March 1832, 5 July 1832 – 26 December 1834, 17 March 1839 – 30 September 1845. The periods of unbroken full entries add up to 43 years and 6 months. As a young diarist, a full entry for John Quincy was often only a few sentences or a paragraph. As he got older, Adams’ daily entries frequently filled or exceeded a page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the days and months lacking full entries, by far the largest portion are represented by draft entries clearly intended for expansion into full entries. Adams resorted to draft or line-a-day entries as substitutes for full entries in the earlier years before he had grown accustomed to the habit of diary keeping. The later draft entries occur mainly during times of heavy public responsibilities in 1821, 1823–1825, and 1835, when he was serving as secretary of state, president, and in the U.S. House of Representatives, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adams kept four diaries that he referred to as “Rubbish” volumes and one line-a-day volume. In addition to diary entries, these “Rubbish” diaries (volumes 47–50) contain various notes and memoranda: lists of visitors, dinner guests, members of Congress, artists for whom he had sat, lands to be surveyed, newspaper titles, and his published and unpublished writings; commentaries on Bible passages; notes on his reading; population statistics; election returns; meteorological observations; and his poetry. The line-a-day diary (volume 23) contains entries for two spans of dates: 1 January 1795 – 12 May 1801 and 5 August 1809 – 30 April 1836.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond utilizing draft and line-a-day entries when he found it impossible to complete a full entry, Adams also, during numerous and extended periods, wrote such entries along with and in addition to full entries. Thus, on any given date, multiple diary entries may be available to users. Analysis to identify and encode personal names and topical subjects was completed on the full entry for each date, except where no full entry existed in which case the draft or line-a-day entry was analyzed.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of the Text</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary is both part of the long-running Series I: Diaries published by the Adams Papers and the project’s first born-digital edition. As such, the Digital Diary adheres to the editorial policy employed across the Adams Papers edition and also includes necessary and practical improvements for the digital environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Adams Papers developed a new editorial policy consistent with current standards for documentary editing with volume 8 of the <em>Adams Family Correspondence</em> <a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/ADMS-04-08-01-pb-0035">(</a><a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/ADMS-04-08-01-pb-0035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xxxv–xliii</a>). Readers may also wish to reference the statements of editorial policy in previous Adams Papers letterpress volumes, especially the <em>Diary and Autobiography of John Adams</em>, <a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/ADMS-01-01-01-pb-0052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1:lii–lxii</a>, and the <em>Adams Family Correspondence</em>, <a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/ADMS-04-01-01-pb-0041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1:xli–xlviii</a>. These statements document the original conception of the Adams Papers project, though parts of them have now been superseded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adams Papers texts are rendered as literally as possible given the limitations of modern typography and the ability to translate handwritten manuscripts into printed and digital documents. This preserves more of the original document and allows the reader to determine the significance of the authors’ spelling, grammar, capitalization, and other mechanical aspects of their writing. In that spirit, the following is a summary of the specifics of the project’s policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Spelling</em> is preserved as found in the diary. Irregular spellings and spelling mistakes, even when they are obviously simple slips of the pen, are retained. The encoded personal names will offer corrected spellings of proper names, but no such corrections are made in the text itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Grammar and syntax</em> are preserved as found in the diary. Inadvertent repetition of words, however, is silently corrected. The exception to this policy in the Digital Diary is when a word is repeated over a page break, as both the transcription and diary manuscript image will be displayed side-by-side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Capitalization</em> is preserved as found in the diary, even when it violates conventional standards, such as lowercase letters used for proper nouns or at the beginnings of sentences. In indeterminate cases, where the editors cannot be certain whether Adams intended for a letter to be capital or lowercase, the editors will follow modern usage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Punctuation</em> is preserved as found in the diary. As Adams used periods and dashes relatively interchangeably, the editors have retained some license to interpret those marks as makes sense grammatically, relying less on the structure of the character (Adams tended to use a single mark that might be either an elongated period or an abbreviated dash) than on the context of the sentence. The punctuation around abbreviations and contractions has been standardized in a limited fashion: (1) Underlining below a superscript is rendered as a period following the superscript. Similarly, two periods or commas under a superscript is rendered as a colon following the superscript. (2) Marks over letters used to indicate contractions or abbreviations have all been rendered as tildes. If such a mark appears over multiple letters within a word, the tilde is placed over the first letter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Abbreviations and contractions</em>, in general, are preserved as found in the diary. Ampersands are retained in all instances, as are superscripts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Missing and illegible matter</em> is indicated by square brackets enclosing the editors’ conjectural readings (with a question mark appended if the reading is uncertain) or suspension points if no reading can be given. Three points are used to indicate a single missing word and four to indicate two missing words. If a single letter of a word is missing, the editors may silently supply it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Canceled matter</em> in the diary (whether scored out or erased) is disregarded unless the editors deem it to be of some significance. In those instances, the text is included but crossed out typographically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Interlineations</em> are included within the body of the text at the point of insertion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Contextualization</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the most important function of the John Quincy Adams Digital Diary is to provide an accurate and authoritative text, the editors also strive to offer additional information to help readers better understand the nature of the diary and the moment in which it was written. Editorial work was informed by the theories and practices of the documentary editing community, the purpose of which is to facilitate engagement with the text by providing context through the editorial apparatus of annotations and an index. This project serves that overarching purpose within a digital environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the primary audience for documentary editions remains the scholarly researcher, project editors collaborated with educators and the MHS Education Department to specifically improve access for the K-12 community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary centers access for a broad community through narrative essays and encoded metadata for people and historical topics. Chronological essays provide synopses of the national and world events that informed John Quincy Adams’ personal experiences for twelve distinct periods of his life. These essays will appear in both short and long forms for varying points of access within the website’s Chronology feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The diary records the thousands of individuals with whom Adams interacted throughout the course of his life. Each identified person named in the diary was assigned a unique identification tag and is recorded in the Cooperative’s names database. Individual records include a person’s full name, birth and death dates, date first mentioned in the diary, and a brief biography, where known.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of the nearly 12,000 full entries were also reviewed and assigned topical headings. This subject analysis was based on approximately 150 historical themes related to American history to 1848 and aligned with K-12 history curricula standards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the context supplied through editorial essays and encoded metadata, the text is also keyword and date searchable. Encoded individuals and topics will also be searchable across the four Cooperative partner editions by the end of 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Guide to Editorial Apparatus</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This guide lists the arbitrary devices used for clarifying the text in the diary. It is considered best practice to prioritize the meaning of text over its visual look on the page when encoding; doing so enables better search and discoverability. Because of this, in some instances the layout of the transcribed text does not precisely replicate John Quincy Adams’ layout on the manuscript page of the diary. For example, while page breaks are noted, line breaks are not preserved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>TEXTUAL DEVICES</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following devices will be used throughout <em>The Adams Papers</em>, including the John Quincy Adams Digital Diary, to clarify the presentation of the text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>[. . .]</td><td>One word is missing or illegible.</td></tr><tr><td>[. . . .]</td><td>Two or more words are missing or illegible.</td></tr><tr><td>[ &nbsp;]</td><td>A number or part of a number is missing or illegible.

<p><em>SPECIFIC DEVICES WITHIN THE JOHN QUINCY ADAMS DIGITAL DIARY</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dates: John Quincy Adams often began diary entries with the day of the month in Arabic numerals followed by the time he awoke in Roman numerals. Thus, 1. VI: means on <a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1817-09-01-p249">1 September 1817</a> he awoke at 6:00 in the morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dominical letters: In his line-a-day diary, volume 23, Adams often denoted Sundays with the corresponding Dominical letter (A through G) in the viewer’s left margin. Adams utilized this device as an aid to finding the day of the week corresponding to any given date within a month. More information on Dominical letters can be found in the <em><a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951002037594p&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catholic Encyclopedia</a></em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visitor lists: Starting in 1825, Adams often began his diary entries with a list of individual’s names, sometimes drawing a box around the list, before starting his diary entry for that date. He explicitly mentions his “<a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v37-1827-08-09-p257">lists of visitors in the margin</a>” in his diary entry for 9 August 1827.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Image quality: Occasionally, diary manuscript page images appear quite faded or have portions that are unreadable on the <a href="https://www.masshist.org/collection-guides/view/fa0279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microfilm</a>. In those instances, the actual text from the diary volume (which may appear different from the manuscript page image in the side-by-side display) has been included in brackets. See, for example, the entries for 1 September 1826, 14 July 1835, and 17 November 1845.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Previous Publication of the Diary</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary is part of Series I: Diaries within the Adams Papers plan of publication. In 1981 project editors published the earliest years of Adams’ diary (1779–1788) in two print volumes, thus commencing the <em>Diary of John Quincy Adams </em>series. The Digital Diary is a continuation of that series and includes this earliest material. While the original annotation has been retained, the treatment of the text has been brought in line with revised project standards, including the retention of superscripts, ampersands, original spelling, paragraphing, and punctuation. Subject and personal name encoding have also been applied as with the rest of the diary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Readers interested in publication of Adams’ diary prior to the 1981 Adams Papers letterpress volumes should consult the introduction to those volumes (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/adams-papers/index.php/view/ADMS-03-01-01-0008" target="_blank">1:xvii–lii</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Massachusetts Historical Society made digital facsimiles of the diary available online as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.masshist.org/jqadiaries/php/" target="_blank">Diaries of John Quincy Adams: A Digital Collection</a>. This website, made possible by a matching grant from Save America’s Treasures in 2003, presents the entire 51-volume diary, searchable by date or diary volume. The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary integrates and builds on this earlier effort.</p>

The digital conversion—based on the original Adams Papers control file begun in the 1950s and steadily updated since that time—was supported by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission and the Massachusetts Historical Society and was initiated with Packard Humanities Institute funds in 2009. The catalog allows public online access to a database of nearly 110,000 records, with some 30,000 cross-referenced links to online, printed, and microfilm editions of the items, or to websites of the holding repositories. Each record contains information on a document’s author, recipient, and date and on the location of the original, if known.</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>(September 1817 to February 1821: President James Monroe’s First Term)</h2>
John Quincy Adams (JQA) had been in America just over a month when he set out from Quincy, Massachusetts, for Washington, D.C., on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1817-09-09-p249">9 September 1817</a>. He arrived in the nation’s capital on the 20th and took the oath of office as United States Secretary of State the morning of the 22d. Richard Rush, who had served as acting secretary of state since March, assisted JQA in adjusting to life at the State Department. JQA kept the office staff that he found upon arrival; his chief clerk, Daniel Brent, is one of the most frequently mentioned individuals in the diary during this period.

<a class="image placeLeft" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/459"><img src="/images/jqa-engraving.jpg" alt="Engraving of JQA">Engraving by Francis Kearney, circa 1824</a> Upon assuming his new role, JQA found that much of the State Department’s correspondence remained unanswered and that the agency’s office hours did not afford sufficient time to complete even basic duties. Work was interrupted by a constant stream of visitors, many of whom came with patronage appeals for themselves or friends. As secretary of state, JQA could appoint or recommend candidates for scores of diplomatic, consular, and administrative posts. Others came to request his intervention with foreign governments. Among them were merchants, ship owners, and southern planters who sought the department’s assistance in obtaining compensation for vessels, cargoes, and slaves illegally confiscated during the wars that preceded 1815. Because of the frequent distractions at his office, the bulk of his work reading and responding to diplomatic correspondence was completed at home, early in the morning or late at night. After less than one week, he complained in his Diary on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1817-09-26-p257">26 September</a> that this burden had affected his eyes.

As a member of President James Monroe’s cabinet, JQA and his peers convened frequently to discuss foreign and domestic issues. JQA’s numerous and lengthy comments on these cabinet meetings provide insight into the personalities and motivations of the president and the department heads. The position of secretary of state had been the stepping stone to the presidency for the last three men to hold the office. JQA recognized the jealousy and competition among his peers in these meetings—especially that of Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, who lusted after the presidency. Henry Clay, who had wanted the office of secretary of state for obvious reasons, remained the administration’s most troublesome critic in Congress. Jockeying for position in the 1824 presidential election began before the end of Monroe’s first term. While JQA claimed to be above the fray, there is little doubt of his interest in the office.

Congress charged the State Department with additional obligations that ranged far beyond the diplomatic realm. Two duties that consumed much of the secretary’s time during the first term concerned the 1820 census and a report on weights and measures. JQA obsessed over the latter of these duties, studying the various standards employed in Europe and throughout the United States. He even obtained the instruments used by European governments to establish their official measurements. Despite his efforts, Congress tabled and ignored the book-length report he submitted in February 1821.

The question of Missouri statehood, raised in 1819, proved to be the most disruptive domestic issue during Monroe’s first term. JQA foresaw that the sectional divide, which had been apparent since the Constitutional Convention of 1787, could only be forestalled. JQA personally opposed the extension of slavery into the West and the creation of additional slave states. However, he valued the preservation of the union and accepted the Missouri Compromise of 1820. He found the solutions suggested to the problem of slavery in the United States, such as the plans of the American Colonization Society, to be naïve and unreasonable. He famously noted on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v31-1820-01-10-p240">10 January 1820</a>, “I take it for granted that the present question is a mere preamble; a title page to a great tragic volume.” His observations at the conclusion of the compromise on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v31-1820-11-29-p440">29 November 1820</a> revealed his fear that the final resolution of the nation’s division over slavery would be found in civil war.

The Panic of 1819 set off a period of economic dislocation. Speculation, especially in land, was the primary cause, and failed banks and businesses the result. Many state banks failed and the Bank of the United States became severely stressed. JQA comments on the numerous institutional and personal bankruptcies as well as the revenue problems this crisis posed for the Federal Treasury.

As secretary of state, JQA interacted with diplomatic representatives from the major and minor powers of Europe. While the ministers from Russia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Prussia, and Sweden appear throughout the diary, they were much less prominent than those from Great Britain, France, and Spain. Sir Charles Bagot represented Great Britain for most of the period. He and JQA had extensive discussions on the unresolved problems that were the legacy of the Treaty of Ghent. Most important among these issues was the establishment of the northern border with Canada at the 49th parallel in the Anglo-American Convention of 20 October 1818. Stratford Canning, who replaced Bagot in September 1820, repeatedly pressed JQA for an American commitment to cooperate with the British prohibition of the Atlantic slave trade. Baron Jean Hyde de Neuville, the French minister, spent much of his time attempting to convince JQA to support the reduction of duties on his country’s exports to the United States. Hyde de Neuville also acted as an intermediary between JQA and Don Luis de Onis, the Spanish minister.

Spain and its problems in the Western Hemisphere consumed more of JQA’s time than any other diplomatic issue. Unable to control much of the land over which it claimed sovereignty, Spain made significant territorial concessions to the United States in the Adams-Onis (Transcontinental) Treaty, signed on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v31-1819-02-22-p024">22 February 1819</a>. Relinquishing its last claim to Florida and recognizing the United States’ expansion to the Pacific Ocean, Spain hoped to maintain control of its South American empire as long as possible. It took two full years before the Spanish ratified and returned the treaty for the U.S. Senate to approve. JQA took a cautious approach to the South American revolutions and independence movements. While he recognized the inevitability of independence in the region, he could not openly acknowledge or support the fact for fear of disrupting relations with the European powers, especially Spain. The South American revolutionary governments aggravated European-American relations by outfitting and manning privateers in U.S. ports, especially Baltimore. These privateers, often described as pirates by JQA, preyed on Atlantic and Caribbean shipping, especially that of Portugal and Spain.
<p class="image center"><a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/768"><img src="/images/lca-silhouette.png" alt="Silhouette of Louisa Catherine Adams by Henry Williams, 1809">Silhouette of Louisa Catherine Adams by Henry Williams, 1809</a></p>
JQA and his family’s relocation to Washington, D.C., in September 1817 proved to be a permanent move. While he continued to make regular short visits to Massachusetts, usually in the late summer and early fall, and would eventually inherit Peacefield, his father’s home in Quincy, his public service kept him in the nation’s capital. In 1820 he purchased a house at 244 F Street. Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA), his socially adept wife, made this home a congenial and inviting place for Washington’s powerful and influential residents to meet. JQA, who recognized his own shortcomings in this realm, relied on his wife’s social gifts. LCA, despite intermittent health problems, hosted dinners, parties, and regular receptions while an emerging Washington society struggled to establish a standard of etiquette during this period. JQA, who chafed under the ridged and time-consuming protocol, was assisted through the ordeal by his wife. Two of LCA’s sisters lived nearby; Carolina Johnson Frye and her husband Nathaniel, and Catherine Johnson Smith and her husband William Steuben were the most frequent and intimate members of the Adamses’ circle. These and other members of LCA’s family occasionally sought JQA’s patronage. His adherence to a strict rule against even a hint of favoritism created family conflict. JQA escaped the stresses at home and work with exercise. In addition to his regular bathing (swimming) in the Potomac River, he took frequent long walks.

The Adams children were in school during this period. George Washington Adams (GWA) and John Adams 2d (JA2) were at Harvard and Charles Francis Adams (CFA) attended schools in Boston and later Washington, D.C. When the boys were in the nation’s capital, their father encouraged them to attend congressional debates and Supreme Court sessions. Despite his efforts, JQA feared his sons would never become the men he hoped. An addition was made to the family in late 1817 when eleven-year-old Mary Catherine Hellen (MCHA), a niece, came to live with the Adamses. She would marry JA2 in 1828 and later be a companion for LCA.

JQA’s Congregationalist origins evolved toward Unitarianism during these years. In Washington, D.C., he attended religious services regularly, but of various faiths. He critiqued each minister and his sermon: speaking style, composition of the sermon, selection of text, and theological significance each received a grade. These reviews also offered him an opportunity to state his personal religious ideas.

The Quincy to which he returned almost every year had changed significantly and held more memories than future for JQA. His mother Abigail Adams (AA) died in <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1818-10-31-p405">October 1818</a>, not long after he had visited, and he mourned her deeply. His father John Adams (JA), now in his mid-eighties, was in obvious decline. Brother Thomas Boylston Adams (TBA), his only living sibling, once his best friend and companion, had been reduced by drink and survived only with assistance from their father. JQA’s life and career was now permanently removed from the town of his birth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>January 1789 to August 1794: Newburyport and Boston</h2>
Over these five years, John Quincy Adams (JQA) progressed from being a law student to becoming a practicing attorney. He also pursued an active social life. A keen, if sometimes caustic, observer of the people he met, JQA recorded impressions both in his diary and in poetry. He also privately agonized over when and how he would achieve financial independence and public prominence. While his law practice barely removed him from economic dependence on his parents, President George Washington recognized his potential and in 1794 nominated him to the diplomatic post that changed the trajectory of his life.

In July 1790 JQA completed his legal studies at Newburyport, under the guidance of Theophilus Parsons, and the Massachusetts Bar admitted him. Health issues, especially insomnia and eye problems, hampered his progress. In August, after considering Newburyport and Braintree, he opened his law practice at Boston, with an office in his father John Adams’ (JA) Court Street house. JQA lost his first case before the Court of Common Pleas in October. The few expansive diary entries in this period reveal a young man with an <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v17-1791-04-07-p001">unsettled frame of mind</a>. “I have not had a moment of Time to spare . . . Yet I have had nothing to do. . . . My present situation is not over eligible: how to improve it is the subject which most employs my mind.”
<p class="image center"><a href="https://www.masshist.org/database/40"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/0054johnadams_blyth_ref.jpg" alt="John Adams by Blyth, ca. 1766">John Adams</a></p>

<p style="clear: both;">For most of 1789 through 1791, JQA’s diary was predominantly brief, single line entries, despite his intentions to write more. In September 1789, promising a renewed effort as a diarist, he blamed a lapse of long entries on poor health, indolence, and his opinion that <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v12-1789-09-06-p235">“The events which have occurred . . . have not been sufficiently interesting to induce me to regret” that he had “omitted to record them.”</a> This attempt lasted less than two weeks. Again, in April 1791, he started <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v17-1791-04-01-p001">“once more an undertaking, which indolence has so often rendered abortive.”</a> This new journalistic vigor lasted a week. The occasional expanded entries during these years were predominantly character portraits of his contemporaries, including his evaluation of the young women he encountered. Some of these comments on women were prose variations of his satirical poem “A Vision,” which he completed in June 1790.</p>
JQA gained his first public acclaim during these years not as a lawyer, but as a writer. Beginning in the summer of 1791, he published letters in the Boston press under various pseudonyms, and by the end of 1793 he had gained international recognition from these writings. Between 3 June and 27 July 1791, he penned eleven letters in the Columbian Centinel under the pseudonym “Publicola” in response to Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man. They were reprinted in New York and Philadelphia and later published in Great Britain. In December 1792 he contributed three letters, again to the Columbian Centinel, as “Menander,” to support theater in Boston and oppose the state anti-theater ordinance banning productions. The statute was repealed in 1793.

In 1792 JQA expanded his regular diary entries to short paragraphs, with an occasional lengthy introspective offering concerning his continued dissatisfaction with the <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v17-1792-05-16-p020">“state of useless and disgraceful insignificancy which has been my lot for some years past.”</a> Despite this despondency, he mentioned more legal work, including his contribution to the successful petition of the town of Quincy to be separated from Braintree.

By 1793 JQA’s reputation and stature in the Boston community won him the honor of delivering the city’s Fourth of July oration. After rewriting it at least three times and repeatedly rehearsing it before friends, he modestly noted that <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v19-1793-07-04-p028">“the performance” was “well received.”</a> Beginning 30 November that year, he published five letters as “Columbus” against Edmund Charles Genet, the French minister to the United States, and other pro-French elements who opposed President Washington’s Neutrality Proclamation. When a series of articles by Massachusetts Attorney General James Sullivan (“Americanus”) challenged him, JQA responded with four letters as “Barneveld.” His diary reflects an evolution of his interests: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v19-1793-12-12-p045">“Very busy for the public, in a manner that will be of no avail to me”</a> and <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v19-1793-12-23-p045">“Still perplexing myself with political affairs.”</a>

JQA claimed that he wrote the “Columbus” and “Barneveld” pieces as a public service and to improve his reputation in Boston, not to seek patronage. Regardless of his motives, on 3 June 1794 he received a letter from his father alerting him that President Washington had nominated him as U.S. minister resident to the Netherlands. Fearing nepotism, JQA consulted JA, who assured him <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v20-1794-06-10-p001">“that he had never uttered a word . . . that a public office should be conferred upon me.”</a> JQA traveled to Philadelphia in July to consult members of the administration and receive his instructions and credentials. He returned to Boston on 21 August. After making the necessary preparations for himself and his brother Thomas Boylston Adams (TBA), who went as his secretary, they sailed 17 September on the Alfred, the first available vessel for London.

Publicly, JQA flourished during these years; privately, he experienced his first romantic relationship that ended in heartbreak. Mary Frazier, the daughter of a Newburyport merchant, became the object of JQA’s affection. Their relationship lasted until late 1790 when Mary’s family demanded an engagement, which JQA’s father forbade at that time. Almost fifty years later JQA recounted in his diary: <a href="/jqadiaries/php/doc?id=jqad33_659">“Four years of exquisite wretchedness, followed this separation, nor was the wound in my bosom healed, till the Atlantic Ocean flowed between us.”</a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>(January 1839 to December 1842)</h2>
During his second decade as a member of the United States House of Representatives, John Quincy Adams (JQA) continued to be an outspoken opponent of the pro-slavery forces’ grip on the nation. Leading abolitionists recognized Adams’s powerful oratory, masterful knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, and frustration with southern domination of the federal government. They consulted him on the case of the Spanish slave ship <i>Amistad</i>. The complicated issues of the case intrigued the statesman, and he agreed to represent the African defendants before the U.S. Supreme Court. This complex legal, diplomatic, and humanitarian contest was the most important slavery-related case before the court until Dred Scott v. Sandford in 1857. Adams considered the methods employed by more extreme abolitionists counterproductive, yet John Tyler’s ascension to the presidency in 1841 pushed Adams to be more assertive in his opposition to slavery.

In July 1839, fifty-three Africans revolted aboard the Spanish slave ship <i>Amistad</i> as they were being transported by their enslavers from Havana to another Cuban port. During the revolt, the Africans killed the ship’s captain and another crew member, and they demanded to be returned to Mendiland (now Sierra Leone). Because the Africans possessed limited navigational knowledge, the remaining <i>Amistad</i> crew were able to divert the vessel from its course. On 24 August a U.S. revenue cutter seized the <i>Amistad</i> off Long Island and brought it into the port of New London, Connecticut. The Africans were imprisoned at New Haven, Connecticut, although charges of murder and piracy were quickly dropped. Instead, the case centered around property rights. First decided in the U.S. District Court at Hartford, Connecticut, the case contained several elements, central to which was the legal status of the Africans. The captain of the revenue cutter claimed salvage rights for taking the <i>Amistad</i>; the Spaniards who had enslaved the Africans claimed them as their property; and the Spanish government demanded that the vessel and the human cargo be returned to a Cuban court. The Van Buren administration, seeking to avoid an international conflict and end another slavery-related issue, wished to return the vessel, the Africans, and the whole case to the Spanish authorities.

In January 1840, the U.S. District Court ruled that the Africans were not slaves. They had been taken from their African homeland in 1838, long after an agreement—to which Spain was a signatory—ended the legal importation of slaves to the western hemisphere. Thus, neither the Spaniards, who claimed the Africans as property, nor the Spanish authorities had any legitimate rights in the affair. The captain of the revenue cutter’s salvage claim was sustained. In April 1840, the U.S. Circuit Court, ruling on Attorney General Henry Dilworth Gilpin’s appeal, upheld the district court’s decision.

While he had agreed to offer opinions and advice on the <i>Amistad</i> case as early as September 1839, JQA did not take a formal role until a year later. Abolitionists Ellis Gray Loring and Lewis Tappan visited the former president at Quincy on 27 October 1840 and convinced him to join the <i>Amistad</i> defense team when the government appeal went before the Supreme Court. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1840-10-27-p113">JQA recorded his initial reluctance</a>: “I endeavoured to excuse myself upon the plea of my age and inefficiency—of the oppressive burden of my duties as a member of the House of Representatives, and my inexperience after a lapse of more than thirty years . . . before judicial tribunals.” However, the abolitionists proved persuasive. “They urged me so much and represented the case of those unfortunate men as so critical, it being a case of life and death, that I yielded.”

The trial began on 22 February 1841. JQA assisted Roger Sherman Baldwin, the defense counsel who had seen the case through the district and circuit courts. Attorney General Gilpin presented the government’s appeal. Baldwin, in support of the lower courts’ decisions, completed his arguments on 23 February. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1841-02-23-p236">JQA observed that his co-counsel’s reasoning</a> “was powerful, and perhaps conclusive;” however, Baldwin “spoke in cautious terms to avoid exciting Southern passions and prejudices, which it is our policy as much as possible to asswage and pacify.” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1841-02-24-p236">JQA opened his defense on 24 February and while</a> “deeply distressed and agitated till the moment when I rose,” he “spoke four hours and a half, with sufficient method and order to witness little flagging of attention, by the judges or the auditory.” Pleased with his performance, he modestly assessed: “I did not I could not answer public expectation—but I have not yet utterly failed.” After a delay in the proceedings, occasioned by the death of Associate Justice Philip Pendleton Barbour, JQA returned to the court on 1 March to conclude his argument on behalf of the <i>Amistad</i> Africans. He spoke for another four hours. Gilpin closed the government’s case the following day. The court’s opinion, delivered on 9 March, affirmed the decision of the lower courts by a seven to one vote. The Africans were free.

During this period of JQA’s public service, the congressman witnessed three different presidential administrations. Elected in 1840 to succeed Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison died after only a month in office. Vice President John Tyler, a strident proslavery Virginian, was elevated to the presidency on 4 April 1841. He refused to requisition a navy vessel to return the now-free <i>Amistad</i> Africans to their homeland. Instead, Abolitionists raised private funds for the voyage. Before their departure in November 1841, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1841-11-19-p512">JQA received a Bible</a> “signed by Cinque, Kinna and Kale for the 35 Mendian Africans of the <i>Amistad</i>.” This “Mendi Bible” remains in the Stone Library at Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Massachusetts.

JQA continued to present anti-slavery petitions in Congress, despite various iterations of the Gag Rule being in place. On 24 January 1842, Adams presented a petition from citizens of Haverhill, Massachusetts, asking Congress to immediately adopt measures to peacefully dissolve the United States. Virginia congressman Thomas Walker Gilmer declared JQA’s action treasonable and called for his censure. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v43-1842-02-03-p035">During the censure hearing in early February, JQA not only ably defended himself but</a> “brought to light the conspiracy among the Southern Members of the Committee of foreign Affairs to displace me as Chairman.” The censure resolution was tabled on 7 February.

Adams realized that age (he was seventy-three when he appeared before the Supreme Court) diminished his physical and mental capacities. However, a few weeks after the <i>Amistad</i> decision, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1841-03-23-p264">he acknowledged his unwavering dedication to public service</a>. “More than 60 years of incessant active intercourse with the world has made political movement to me as much a necessary of life as atmospheric air. . . . And thus while a remnant of physical power is left me to write and speak, the world will retire from me before I shall retire from the world.” He seemed energized by his role in the <i>Amistad</i> case and also perhaps by his opposition to the administration of <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1841-04-04-p295">John Tyler, whom he described</a> as “a political sectarian of the Slave-driving, Virginian Jeffersonian school— Principled against all improvement— With all the interests and passions, and vices of Slavery rooted in his moral and political constitution.” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v43-1842-05-21-p129">Adams’ public stature varied dramatically in the North and South</a>. “Not a day passes but I receive Letters from the North and sometimes the West asking for an autograph, and a scrap of poetry or of prose, and from the South almost daily Letters of insult, profane obscenity and filth— These are indexes to the various estimation in which I am held in the free and servile sections of this Union.”

His reputation as an author and orator on topics as far ranging as China, society and civilization, temperance, and faith, made him one of the most sought-after lecturers of the era. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1841-10-08-p481">This popularity overwhelmed him</a>. “The Lecture Mania is yet more annoying. . . . not a day passes but I receive invitations to deliver Lectures.” He declined most requests and avoided lecturing on political issues. Ostensibly a Whig statesman, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v42-1839-12-11-p282">JQA refused to take part in party conventions or address political meetings</a>, believing, “since I had held myself the Office of the President of the United States, I felt it my duty to abstain from all personal interference in the Presidential election.”

Away from public life, his households in Quincy and Washington, D.C., consisted of wife Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA), daughter-in-law Mary Catherine Hellen Adams (MCHA), and granddaughters Georgeanna Frances (Fanny) Adams and Mary Louisa Adams. Grief struck when nine-year-old Fanny died on 20 November 1839 after a protracted illness, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v41-1840-08-04-p052">JQA recalled</a>, “the agonies of our separation from that adored child, the pang of which will go with me to my dying day,” and that her “sufferings . . . from hour to hour for weeks and months in succession disqualified me for all energetic action.”

In 1839 JQA compiled a list of thirty-four sittings he had done for various artists throughout his life. By 1842, advances in rudimentary photography added a new form of portrait sitting. On 27 September he went to John Plumbe’s Daguerrian Gallery in Boston to have his photograph taken. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v43-1842-09-27-p254">This first experience with the new technology proved unsatisfactory</a>. “They kept me there an hour and a half, and took seven or eight impressions, all of them very bad.” Each photo required the sitter to remain perfectly still and focused on an object. Adams could not keep his eyes open. “I dosed and the picture was asleep— I gave it up in despair.” None of these first photographs are extant, although Adams would again sit for a photographer the following year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>(March 1821 to February 1825: President James Monroe’s Second Term)</h2>
Throughout the four years of James Monroe’s second presidential term, John Quincy Adams (JQA) continued to serve as secretary of state. It was during these years that JQA scrutinized U.S. policy regarding the revolutions occurring in Latin America and developed the strategy that became known as the Monroe Doctrine. While his duties as secretary of state and the constant stream of visitors to his office kept JQA busy, almost as soon as Monroe won reelection the contest for who would attain the presidency in 1824 occupied much of JQA’s time and attention.

<a class="image placeLeft" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/457"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/4736_ref.jpg" alt="Engraving of JQA" />Charles Kennedy Burt, 1870</a> While JQA kept a close eye on the political landscape, he still had to perform the duties of secretary of state. Relations with the major powers continued much as they had during the first Monroe administration. Stratford Canning, British minister to the U.S., continued to press for cooperation in suppressing the Atlantic slave trade. JQA could only listen, not act, as powerful slave-holding interests in America made serious consideration impossible. Other Anglo-American issues included resolution of the border with Canada and access to British West Indian ports. One important area of agreement between Britain and the U.S. concerned Latin America.

<a class="image placeRight" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/4189"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images26/7271_monroe_work_ref.jpg" alt="Lithograph by Nicolas-Eustache Maurin for Messers Dogget, after painting by Stuart, ca. 1828" />Lithograph by Nicolas-Eustache Maurin for Messers Dogget, after painting by Stuart, ca. 1828</a> The success of the republican experiment in the United States threatened the conservative European powers. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v32-1821-11-28-p121">As early as 28 November 1821</a>, the prescient secretary of state recognized: “They all hated us for our principles— They dreaded the effect of our example; the standing refutation of their doctrines in our prosperous condition, and the danger to themselves in our constantly growing power.” Just as during the previous four years, the rapid decline of the Spanish-American empire and the rise of revolutionary, and subsequently independent, Latin American states provided JQA with his most important diplomatic challenge. After the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, conservative European powers, led by Alexander I of Russia, formed the Holy Alliance to stop the spread of republican government and reestablish divine right monarchy. In 1822 the Holy Alliance defeated a republican movement in Spain. They next threatened to return the newly independent Latin American states to colonial status. About the same time, the Monroe administration recognized Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru as independent nations. The renewal of any European colonial power in the western hemisphere was antithetical to American republican ideals and potentially harmful to national security and commerce.

British foreign minister George Canning, knowing it was of interest to both Britain and the U.S. that the Holy Alliance not reassert colonial control in Latin America, proposed a joint Anglo-American statement. During October and November 1823, JQA worked to convince the president and the cabinet to make its own unilateral statement. He summed up his reasoning in his <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v34-1823-11-07-p149">7 November diary entry</a>; while British and American interests in thwarting the Holy Alliance coincided, “It would be more candid as well as more dignified to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France, than to come in as a Cock-boat in the wake of the British man of War.” Despite some opposition in the cabinet and former president Jefferson’s advice against it, a hesitant Monroe approved the idea. Over the next weeks, JQA drafted the portion of the president’s 2 December annual message to Congress that became known as the Monroe Doctrine. On 27 November, as a diplomatic courtesy, JQA informed Russian minister Baron Van Tuyll de Serooskerken of the contents of the policy. He <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v34-1823-11-27-p149">commented in his diary</a>: “I considered this as the most important paper that ever went from my hands.”

The period popularly known as the Era of Good Feelings (1817–1825) ended during the 1824 presidential campaign. With the demise of the Federalist Party, the single national Democratic-Republican Party did not result in political unity. Sectional and other divisions, as well as the personal competition of the men seeking to succeed President Monroe, made this a particularly contentious period. The election campaign began in 1821, and during the next three years several potential candidates were eliminated until only four remained. In addition to JQA, Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford of Georgia, congressman and sometime Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, and General Andrew Jackson of Tennessee stayed in the contest. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, an early aspirant, declared for the vice presidency after Jackson’s popularity in the South surpassed his. Throughout the campaign supporters of the other candidates assailed JQA’s character and reputation. While he responded on occasion, usually he heeded the advice he recorded in his diary on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v32-1821-12-31-p160">31 December 1821</a>: “To answer newspaper accusations would be an endless task. The tongue of falsehood can never be silenced: and I have not time to spare from public business to the vindication of myself.” Throughout the campaign, he kept his own counsel. On <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v32-1822-07-11-p335">11 July 1822</a>, his 55th birthday, he lamented: “I need advice very much; but have no one to advise me.”

One of the great changes that took place during the 1824 election campaign concerned the nominating process. There is no provision in the Constitution for the nomination of presidential candidates, and since 1796 caucuses of the political parties’ congressional delegations met informally and selected their candidates without direct input from the voting public. As there remained only one viable political party in 1824, it was presumed the congressional nominee would almost certainly be elected. JQA condemned the caucus system on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v32-1822-05-09-p280

 ">9 May 1822</a>, referring to the two houses of Congress as “the Pretorian Guards, who will in substance if not in form set up the Empire at Auction.” Throughout 1823, several states passed resolutions against the caucus system and allowed presidential electors to be chosen by popular vote rather than by state legislatures. However, the caucus met before the election and selected Crawford, while various state legislatures nominated JQA, Jackson, and Clay.

The vote divided among the four candidates; no one obtained the majority necessary for election. Jackson led the popular as well as the electoral vote, JQA came in second in both, Crawford finished a distant third, and Clay fourth. The 12th Amendment provided that, if no one received a majority, the candidates with the three highest electoral votes could continue the contest in the House of Representatives. There each state, regardless of population, had one vote, and a majority of the states was necessary for election. Between the counting of the electoral votes on 1 December 1824 and the vote in the House on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v33-1825-02-09-p066">9 February 1825</a>, the candidates attempted to coalesce support in order to gain the majority. Clay decided to throw his support behind JQA, whose national outlook most resembled his own. This move proved decisive. JQA took thirteen states, Jackson seven, and Crawford four. Soon after, JQA named Clay his secretary of state, and Jackson’s supporters accused them of a “corrupt bargain.”

<a class="image placeLeft" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/997"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/81_154_g_hclay_ref.jpg" alt="Engraving of Henry Clay" />Engraving of Henry Clay</a> JQA’s family remained a concern. His wife, Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA), continued to be one of the capital’s most remarkable hostesses and a great asset to the socially challenged presidential candidate. Despite frequent illness, she persisted with her biweekly levees. On <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v34-1824-01-08-p201">8 January 1824</a>, the Adamses held a great ball in honor of General Andrew Jackson, ostensibly to celebrate the anniversary of his 1815 victory at New Orleans. The ulterior motive was to promote JQA’s popularity and presidential candidacy. The ball was held at their F Street home, purchased 30 March 1821. While they moved several times after 1825, they would return to that house in 1838.

JQA continued to worry about his sons. The youngest, Charles Francis Adams (CFA), matriculated at Harvard in 1821 after narrowly passing his entrance examination in Latin. JQA feared that some personal grudges held against him by members of the faculty might affect his sons at college. However, he discovered that his eldest son, George Washington Adams (GWA), ranked 30th in his class and that his middle son, John Adams (JA2), ranked 45th in his. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v32-1821-09-30-p082">On 30 September</a>, JQA recorded “a sleepless Night— Cares for the welfare and future prospects of my children; mortification at the discovery how much they have wasted of their time at Cambridge . . . I find them all three, coming to manhood, with indolent minds.” On 2 May 1823 JA2 was expelled from Harvard; his and GWA’s subsequent tragic lives and careers would validate their father’s concern.

While a successful statesman and diplomat, JQA proved less than prudent as an investor. He occasionally made mistakes in trusting family and friends with his money and investments. In the summer of 1823 he purchased Columbia Mills, a water-powered flour mill on Rock Creek north of Georgetown. LCA’s cousin George Johnson, who was near bankruptcy, convinced JQA to make the purchase. JQA sold government bonds and mortgaged the F Street property to raise the money. A year later, on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v35-1824-08-25-p226">25 August 1824</a>, he concluded that the first year “has been a total and a severe disappointment; and I have no reason to expect any thing better from the second.” The mill proved to be a continuing drain on his resources and remained a financial liability for the rest of his life.

Despite his public concerns and private burdens, JQA did enjoy diversions and regular recreation that he noted throughout his diary. He attended the theater frequently and critiqued the plays and performers. When the theater season ended in the fall, he spent more time reading, writing, and playing chess. He continued a vigorous physical regimen throughout the year. During cool weather he walked early each morning, noting in his diary the route, destination, or time spent in perambulations. In warm weather he swam; JQA pursued swimming with a greater passion than any other exercise and sometimes pushed himself to extremes. On <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v34-1823-06-19-p075">19 June 1823</a> he reflected, “I follow this practice for exercise, for health, for cleanliness and for pleasure.” However, his physician “and all my friends think I am now indulging it to excess. . . . I must now limit my fancies for this habit, which is not without danger.”

These four years are among the most eventful in JQA’s long public life. At the peak of his power and influence as a statesman, his diary is uneven in its revelation of the man’s thoughts and views. At times it is expansive and detailed, while at other moments, especially when pressed for time, he merely records a brief sketch of the diurnal events. The diary proved both a joy and a burden. On <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v31-1821-03-20-p540">20 March 1821</a>, he admitted to himself: “Had I spent upon any work of Science or Literature, the time employed upon this Diary, it might perhaps have been permanently useful to my Children and my Country— I have devoted too much time to it— My physical powers sink under it.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2></h2>
<h2>September 1794 to August 1801: the Netherlands and Prussia</h2>
This seven-year period launched John Quincy Adams’ (JQA) extraordinary life of public service, brought him to maturity, and marked the way for his professional and personal future. His appointments at The Hague and Berlin, at a critical time in European history, provided indispensable training and knowledge that would serve to make him the preeminent American diplomat of the first quarter of the nineteenth century. His courtship and marriage to Louisa Catherine Johnson (LCA) in 1797 ushered in a new phase of his life and the concomitant pleasures and responsibilities of being a husband and father. LCA’s frequent health issues and failed pregnancies weighed on him, and he rejoiced in the birth of their first son, George Washington Adams (GWA), in April 1801. Adding to the complexity of his public life was the fact that his father John Adams (JA) held the presidency from 1797 to 1801. JQA, particularly sensitive to any hint of nepotism, found the relationship uncomfortable at best. While abroad, he sent scores of letters to the U.S. secretaries of state that offered detailed reports on the civil, diplomatic, and military events in Europe. His letters to family members were also an important source of news for JA during his presidency. His diary provides a more intimate view of the world through which he travelled, with unvarnished observations of the people and societies he encountered.

JQA received word of his appointment as U.S. minister resident to the Netherlands on 5 June 1794. He sailed to his posting, by way of England, on 17 September aboard the ship Alfred, a vessel he described as “a dull sailor” and <a href="/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v21-1794-09-18-p001">“moreover old, crazy and leaky.”</a> His brother Thomas Boylston Adams (TBA) went as his secretary. The brothers arrived at London on 15 October after nearly a month’s passage. Before moving on to The Hague, JQA discussed the ongoing Anglo-American treaty negotiations with John Jay. The 28-year-old bachelor also socialized and took in the London theater. After a visit at John Singleton Copley’s home where he enjoyed the company of the artist’s daughters, JQA mused: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v21-1794-10-27-p012">“There is something so fascinating in the women I meet with in the Country, that it is well for me, I am obliged immediately to leave it.”</a>

<a class="image center" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/73"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/801_ref.jpg" alt="Miniature portrait, watercolor on ivory by Mr. Parker, 1795" />Thomas Boylston Adams</a>

He arrived at The Hague on 31 October. Less than three months later, William V, the hereditary ruler of the Dutch Republic, was forced to flee the country, replaced by the new French-supported Batavian Republic. Although he was wary of the French, JQA did not hold a high opinion of the stadtholder. Shortly after they fled to England, he described William V as <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v20-1795-02-02-p030">“well disposed, with a good heart &amp; a feeble mind”</a> and his wife Wilhelmina as “detested almost universally.” While in the Netherlands, JQA found he had too much time on his hands. His diary contains numerous examples of his frustration with diplomatic life in Europe. Dinners, theater, and concerts broke some of the monotony. However, despite it being “an easy life” he found it impossible <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1795-03-13-p001">“to reconcile it, with a disposition for activity.”</a> One of his most important functions while as U.S. minister to the Netherlands was managing the critical relationship with the Dutch bankers who loaned money to the U.S. government, especially Jan and Wilhem Willink. As he would do throughout his life, JQA spent much of his free time reading and walking.

In October 1795, he received instructions to go to London for the exchange of ratifications of the Jay Treaty, which settled issues left unresolved between the United States and Great Britain after the Revolutionary War and preserved American neutrality. Delayed by weather, he missed the exchange. The trip, however, was not without consequence. He sat for Copley, who produced a dashing portrait as a gift for Abigail Adams (AA). On 11 November, he dined at the home of American merchant Joshua Johnson, who served as the U.S. consul at London and whose residence was a hub for Americans in that city. There he found, among the seven Johnson daughters, his future wife, Louisa Catherine. While his diary entry for that date stated that <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1795-11-11-p063">“Mr: Johnson’s daughters entertained us with good music,”</a> a few months later, he revealed some anxiety about the path he had taken. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1796-03-02-p097">“Ring from Louisa’s finger. . . . Placed in a very difficult dilemma. Know not how I shall escape from it.”</a>

<a class="image center" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/71"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/3081_ref.jpg" alt="Miniature oil portrait, circa 1792" />Louisa Catherine Johnson (Mrs. John Quincy Adams)</a>

JQA returned to the Netherlands at the end of May 1796. There he continued as before, recognizing that <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1796-06-xx-p111">“Too much of this time is devoted to reading, and too little to Society. But I was not formed to shine in company, nor to be delighted with it.”</a> His diary includes more about his reading than any other subject during this period. He consumed translations of Greek and Roman classics, modern histories and biographies, economics, and poetry. In addition to his own study of the Dutch language he regularly took lessons in Italian. On 6 August 1796, JQA learned that President George Washington had nominated him to be the U.S. minister plenipotentiary to Portugal, and he made preparations to move to Lisbon. In the meantime, his father succeeded Washington as president and determined his son would be of greater service as minister to Prussia. Shortly before leaving the Netherlands, JQA received notice of that appointment. Because he had resolved never to hold public office under his father’s nomination, he recorded the news as <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1797-07-07-p177">“some very unpleasant intelligence, personally concerning myself.”</a>

Despite the regular correspondence between JQA and LCA during the thirteen months before he returned to London, there is no direct comment about LCA in JQA’s diary until he saw her again on 13 July 1797. Only two weeks later, on 26 July, they married. Not long after, he learned that Joshua Johnson’s finances had collapsed. JQA treated the issue carefully in his diary with entries such as <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1797-08-30-p181">“Mr: Johnson ill.— The cause, an unhappy one”</a> and <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1797-08-31-p181">“the situation has become very painful.”</a> LCA’s family left for the United States in early September.

<a class="image center" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/3729"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images24/4948joshua_ref.jpg" alt="Miniature portrait, oil on canvas by an unidentified artist, [ca. 1792]" />Joshua Johnson</a>

Upon receiving his instructions and credentials, JQA set off for Berlin with LCA and TBA, arriving on 7 November. JQA was charged with renewing a treaty with Prussia as well as providing intelligence concerning events in Europe. Life in Berlin—both professionally and personally—tested the young American diplomat. Less than two weeks after his arrival, King Frederick William II died, rendering JQA’s credentials invalid. On 19 November, LCA suffered the first of at least four miscarriages that she had while in Prussia. Before the end of that month JQA confided in the diary: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1797-11-26-p193">“I have never before in the course of my life, been afflicted with so many real and severe calamities flocking upon one another at once, as I have experienced from the day of my arrival here.”</a>

Much of the anxiety concerning his relationship to the Prussian government was relieved when King Frederick William III made an exception and received JQA on 5 December, seven months prior to the arrival of his new credentials. Once he and LCA were presented at the Prussian court, they were expected to participate in that elaborate society. The king and queen, the extended royal family, members of the aristocracy, and many of the foreign diplomats hosted an endless round of social events. True to form, JQA participated but chafed at the obligation. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1798-01-06-p206">“There is stiffness, coldness, formality, politeness, laboured affability, studied attention and every thing except that . . . which constitutes the charm of conviviality.”</a> TBA’s return to America in the fall of 1798 created a void in JQA’s life. He lost a <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1798-09-30-p231">“faithful friend, and kind companion, as well as an industrious and valuable assistant.”</a>

Whenever JQA could escape the demands of diplomatic and social duties, he continued his extensive reading, walked for exercise, and attempted to improve his language skills. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1799-02-10-p247">“I study German between two and three hours at least every day, and make scarcely any progress.”</a> He did, however, fulfill his major diplomatic charge when on 11 July 1799 (his thirty-second birthday) he signed a new Prussian-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce. By the end of 1799, he seemed to have settled into his life in Berlin. The exception, however, was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1799-12-xx-p283">“the state of my wife’s health . . . The subject preys upon my spirits more than I can express.”</a>

Beginning in the spring of 1799, JQA and LCA occasionally escaped the demands of Berlin society by taking lengthy tours into the country. Each journey, in addition to relief from the city, held the promise of improving LCA’s health. The most remarkable of these was a three-month trip to Silesia beginning in July 1800. The diary includes some of JQA’s observations; however, he provided a detailed travel journal and history in a series of 28 letters to TBA, which his brother published anonymously in 1801 in the Port Folio, a new Philadelphia literary magazine.

On 26 April 1801, he received a letter of recall signed by his father. JQA had become a father two weeks earlier with the birth of GWA, recording the event in his diary, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1801-04-12-p322">“I have this day to offer my humble and devout thanks to almighty God, for the birth of a son.”</a> After the formalities of taking leave of the king and the Prussian government, nothing held JQA and his family in Europe. They left Berlin in mid-June and sailed from Hamburg on 8 July. Unfavorable winds delayed their arrival at Philadelphia until 4 September.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>January 1843 to February 1848</h2>
During the last five years of his life John Quincy Adams (JQA) continued to serve in the United States House of Representatives. He witnessed the annexation of Texas and the Mexican-American War, the settling of the Anglo-American boundary in the Oregon Territory, the repeal of the Gag Rule, and the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution. As his health continued to deteriorate, he recorded in his diary the physical trials of aging, among which was his ability to hold a pen. By September 1845 Adams began to increasingly rely on amanuenses to whom he dictated his diary entries when his own hand failed him.

JQA had opposed the annexation of Texas since it had declared its independence from Mexico in 1836, because he believed it would enter the union as a slave state. His fears were well-grounded. The United States and the Republic of Texas signed a treaty of annexation on 12 April 1844, and President John Tyler submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratification ten days later. In June the vote failed to garner the required two-thirds majority. Pro-Texas congressmen then put forth a joint resolution on annexation, which needed only a majority vote in both houses. In January 1845 JQA spoke against the resolution on the floor of the House and <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1845-02-19-p032">the following month noted that his efforts were</a> “without avail.” “The heaviest calamity that ever befel myself and my country was this day consummated,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1845-02-28-p032">JQA wrote when the resolution passed on 28 February.</a>

The annexation of Texas exacerbated tensions between the United States and Mexico. Armed conflict over the disputed border between the Rio Grande and Nueces Rivers prompted President James K. Polk to declare war on Mexico in April 1846. On 11 May JQA cast one of only fourteen votes in the House opposing the declaration. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1846-05-11-p548">He described it as</a> a “most unrighteous War” and asserted that the “lying preamble” to the bill, which claimed Mexico initiated the conflict, was “base, fraudulent and false.”

War with Mexico increased concern that unsettled border issues with Great Britain might make the United States vulnerable to another conflict. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1846-03-25-p449">JQA believed America’s</a> “right, to Latitude 54–40 . . . was perfect, with the single exception of actual possession” and that “Great Britain had no right there, of permanent possession.” He did not think war with Britain was likely, and he opposed a compromise over the Oregon Territory. He again found himself in the minority, when the Oregon Treaty, signed 15 June 1846, placed the boundary at the 49th parallel.

Two of JQA’s pet causes triumphed in Congress during these years. On 3 December 1844 JQA introduced a resolution to repeal the Gag Rule and restore the freedom of petition and debate in the House. After an eight-year battle over the issue that included two attempts to censure Adams, the House finally adopted the resolution that same day. The fate of the Smithson bequest was the second issue JQA championed, having chaired or been a member of the select committee on the Smithsonian fund since 1836. Over the years the funds had been invested in four different states’ bonds, with meager success. Thus, Adams was pleased when, in early 1846, <a href="/publications/jqadiariesdocument/jqadiaries-v45-1846-01-09-p363">the federal government provided</a> “for the recovery of the money vested in the Stocks of those four States.” After JQA’s decade-long struggle to preserve and apply the funds of James Smithson’s gift to a legitimate scientific purpose, President Polk signed the Smithsonian Bequest Act on 10 August 1846.

Adams experienced the last of his long-distance travels during this period. In the summer of 1843 he visited Quebec, Montreal, and Niagara Falls, in Canada, accompanied by his grandson John Quincy Adams (JQA2), daughter-in-law Abigail Brown Brooks Adams (ABA), and her father Peter Chardon Brooks. When JQA returned to Massachusetts, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v44-1843-08-13-p027">he ruminated in his diary</a> on the crowds of well-wishers he encountered, noting that the “series of receptions and processions which from the borders of Canada to my quiet retirement at home, have signalized the month of my recent excursion as among the most memorable periods of my life.” During the trip JQA received a letter from Ormsby Mitchel, professor of mathematics and astronomy at Cincinnati College, asking him to speak at the dedication of a new astronomical observatory in Cincinnati, Ohio. Adams’ love of astronomy and his desire to visit that state led him to enthusiastically accept the offer. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v44-1843-09-19-p058">He spent several months researching and writing his speech</a>. “My task is to turn this transient gust of enthusiasm for” astronomy “into a permanent and persevering national pursuit which may extend the bounds of human knowledge.” JQA left Quincy on 25 October, and after stopping at Buffalo, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, and Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, he arrived in Cincinnati on 8 November. The following day he attended the rainy dedication of the observatory, where he read an address at the laying of the cornerstone, and he delivered his oration on 10 November. His trip concluded with a stop in Pittsburgh before arriving in Washington, D.C., on 23 November. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v44-1843-11-07-p119">JQA again relished the crowds that turned out to meet him, although he found the necessity of contemporaneous public speaking somewhat irksome.</a> “These premeditated addresses by men of the most consummate ability, and which I am required to answer off hand without an instant for reflection, are distressing beyond measure, and humiliating to agony.”

Adams’ age was catching up with him. In 1843 he asked to be excused from the House Committee on Manufactures, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v44-1843-12-13-p149">believing his health made it</a> “impossible for me to discharge the arduous duties of that office as they ought to be performed.” On 11 July 1844—his 77th birthday—JQA and his wife Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA), “whose arm was linked in mine,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v44-1844-07-11-p374">both suffered injuries in a fall from a train platform</a>. Perhaps none of the trials of aging, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1846-07-12-p650">which Adams described as</a> “a plant withered at the root, a tree, dying downward from the top,” bothered the statesmen as much as his deteriorating handwriting. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1845-09-08-p244">“I shake like an aspen leaf,”</a> he wrote in September 1845, and by the <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v46-1846-10-31-p053">end of the month he</a> “was compelled to desist from the practice which I had maintained . . . for more than half a century of keeping in my own hand a daily journal of the incidents of my life.” Yet he faithfully continued his diary. JQA utilized as amanuenses his daughters-in-law ABA and Mary Catherine Hellen Adams (MCHA), his granddaughter Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA2), and most frequently his eldest granddaughter, Mary Louisa Adams, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1845-10-02-p273">whom he called</a> “my proxy.” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v46-1846-10-31-p053">By the summer of 1846 JQA had regained</a> “partially the use of my right hand.” He continued to pen diary entries on and off for the rest of his life, supplemented, when necessary, by an amanuensis.

<a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v45-1845-07-26-p182">In 1845 JQA authored a summation of his life in his diary</a>. He characterized his career in public service as “on the whole highly auspicious.” He identified both his public “friends and benefactors”—George Washington, James Madison, and James Monroe—and his “base, malignant and lying enemies”—namely Andrew Jackson. He placed Thomas Jefferson in his own category, describing him as “a hollow and treacherous friend.” Looking back on the vicissitudes of his life, JQA acknowledged his “advantages of education perhaps unparalleled” among his contemporaries and the “principles of integrity, of benevolence, of industry and frugality, and the lofty Spirit of patriotism and Independence taught me from the cradle.” When he weighed his life “in all its fluctuations,” he found it had “been more successful than I deserved.”

Adams easily won reelection as the representative of the 8th Massachusetts congressional district in November 1846. On the 20th he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while walking in Boston with his friend Dr. George Parkman. For the rest of the year, Adams recuperated at the home of his son Charles Francis Adams (CFA). JQA began to improve by January 1847 and later recounted his convalescence in his diary, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v46-1847-03-14-p103">penning what he called his“Posthumous Memoir.”</a> The congressman returned to Washington, D.C., on 12 February. When he took his seat in the House the following day, he was greeted by a standing ovation. During the recess that summer, he and LCA celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on 26 July in Quincy. As he returned to Washington, D.C., <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v46-1847-11-01-p205">in the fall he presciently mused</a>: “It seemed to me on leaving home as if it was upon my last great journey.”

John Quincy Adams collapsed on the floor of the House on 21 February 1848. Carried to the office of the speaker, fellow Massachusettsian Robert Winthrop, Adams died there two days later. His funeral was held in the U.S. Capitol on 26 February, with LCA too bereaved to attend and CFA (who had arrived by train from Boston) and MCHA representing the Adams family. A committee of House members accompanied the statesman’s body from Washington, D.C., to Quincy, where he was buried on 11 March. LCA died four years later, on 15 May 1852, and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. That December they were both reinterred in the crypt of the First Church in Quincy alongside John Adams (JA) and Abigail Adams (AA).

By the time of his death, JQA’s diary encompassed 68 years of entries and contained over 15,000 manuscript pages in 51 diary volumes. JQA himself best summarized the importance of his diary. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v46-1846-10-31-p053">On 31 October 1846, he wrote,</a> “There has perhaps not been another individual of the human race of whose daily existence from early childhood to four score years has been noted down with his own hand so minutely as mine.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>January 1830 to December 1834: Washington, D.C., and Quincy</h2>
On 1 November 1830 John Quincy Adams (JQA) went from being a retired, former president to an elected member of the United States House of Representatives. He was chosen to represent the Plymouth district of Massachusetts for the 22d Congress and took his seat in the House in December 1831. Thus, Adams is the only former president to subsequently serve in the House of Representatives, a position he held until his death in 1848. Both his wife Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA) and youngest son Charles Francis Adams (CFA) disapproved of his return to public office, but JQA relished his new position. His diary records in detail his fascination with the mechanics of congressional politics and the inner workings of the House.

John Quincy Adams spent the first part of 1830 in fitful retirement, believing his tenure as a public servant had ended yet unsure how to spend his days. On 11 July—his birthday—<a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v36-1830-07-11-p490">he lamented</a>: “My grand climacteric is turned, and I enter upon the sixty-fourth year of my age. In turning back to the notice of the last year’s anniversary, the thought presses upon me of how little has since been effected of that preparation which even then formed an essential part of my duty.” JQA decided to write a biography of his father, John Adams (JA), a task which, though never completed, led him to organize his father’s papers. He filled his time reading Cicero and the Bible and researching and writing articles on the Russo-Turkish war and on Great Britain for the <i>American Annual Register</i>.

On 17 September 1830 JQA learned that the incumbent candidate for the congressional district in which his hometown of Quincy was located would not seek reelection. Congressman Edward Everett approached Adams to ask if he would stand for office. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v36-1830-09-25-p534">JQA pondered in his diary how he should respond</a>: “To say that I would accept, would be so near to asking for a vote, that I did not feel disposed to go so far— I wished the People to act spontaneously; at their own discretion.” When he learned of his election, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v38-1830-11-07-p022">JQA noted his delight with the new position</a>. “This call upon me by the People of the District in which I reside, to represent them in Congress, has been spontaneous . . . I have received nearly three votes in four, throughout the district. My Election as President of the United States was not half so gratifying to my inmost Soul— No election or appointment conferred upon me ever gave me so much pleasure.”

The first session of the 22d Congress convened on 5 December 1831. Adams attended nearly every subsequent session until his death in 1848, missing only sessions in the winter of 1846–1847 when he was ill. His diary during these years served as the perfect outlet for his detailed reminiscences of each day’s debate, noting the petitions and resolutions submitted, the votes taken, and their tallies. He particularly commented on the various speakers and the merits of their oratorical skills.

<span class="image center"><img src="/publications/jqadiaries/images/capitol.jpg" alt="View of the Capitol of the United States, by Joseph Andrews, 1834" />View of the Capitol of the United States, by Joseph Andrews, 1834</span>

In 1831 Adams became chairman of the House Committee on Manufactures, a position he held until 1841, and his diary recounts the minutiae of these committee meetings. When President Andrew Jackson called for a reduction of the tariff in his annual address to Congress, JQA, in his position as chairman, worked with Secretary of the Treasury Louis McLane to compose a compromise bill calling for an end to the national debt, tariff concessions for southern states, and a system of internal improvements. The compromise tariff bill that emerged from JQA’s committee became law on 14 July 1832. South Carolina subsequently declared the 1832 tariff unconstitutional and refused to collect the funds. President Jackson and his congressional allies responded with the Force Bill (which JQA supported), signed into law on 1 March 1833, which authorized the president to use whatever means he deemed necessary to enforce federal tariffs.

Another national issue with which JQA was closely involved was the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. JQA supported the bank and its president, Nicholas Biddle, believing that it provided a necessary source of funding for internal improvements and American businesses. In 1832 the bank applied for a new charter, and from 22 March to 17 April JQA traveled to Philadelphia as part of a House committee to inquire into its affairs. When the committee issued a majority report against the Bank, JQA produced a minority report on 14 May in its support. Congress eventually rechartered the bank in July 1833, but President Jackson vetoed the measure. That September he tapped Roger Brooke Taney to be the new Secretary of the Treasury and oversee the removal of the bank’s deposits to state banks. In April 1834, JQA tried to present a resolution opposing Taney’s actions, but Speaker of the House Andrew Stevenson prevented him from taking the floor. JQA subsequently published his intended speech defending both Biddle and the Bank.

During these years John Quincy Adams became increasingly interested in the burgeoning Anti-Masonic political party. He believed that Freemasonry was an antisocial and exclusive order whose secret oaths were anathema to contemporary American society. In May 1831 he attended the Massachusetts Anti-Masonic convention and was briefly considered as their candidate for the 1832 presidential election. He was the party’s choice for gubernatorial candidate in 1833. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1833-09-12-p137">On 12 September he accepted the nomination,</a> “which casts me again upon the stormy ocean of political electioneering when I hoped and believed I was snug in the Port.” JQA finished second behind his House colleague John Davis of Worcester, the National Republican candidate

His return to national political service meant JQA once again spent most winters in Washington, D.C., and summers in Quincy. During these years Adams began traveling by train, considerably shortening the time required for the trip compared to previous routes by boat and stage. These trips up and down the eastern seaboard were not, however, without peril. On 8 November 1833, while a passenger on the Camden and Amboy Railway, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1833-11-08-p173">JQA witnessed the Hightstown train wreck</a>—the earliest recorded railroad accident involving the death of a passenger. While no one in JQA’s car was hurt, one passenger in the second car died and several others were severely injured. The scene brought forth “a trial of feeling, to which I had never before been called,” recorded Adams.

The first years of the 1830s brought significant changes for the Adams family. JQA and LCA welcomed three more grandchildren, bringing the total to four. Georgeanna Frances Adams, the second daughter of John Adams (JA2) and Mary Catherine Hellen Adams (MCHA), was born on 10 September 1830; and Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA2) and John Quincy Adams (JQA2), the children of CFA and Abigail Brown Brooks Adams (ABA), were born on 13 August 1831 and 23 September 1833, respectively. JQA took a particular interest in his eldest grandchild, Mary Louisa Adams (born 1828), also the daughter of JA2 and MCHA. He <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1833-08-05-p122">tried to teach her the alphabet.</a> “After repetitions almost numberless of pointing out the same Letter or the same Syllable to a child, it forgets them,” the frustrated grandfather confessed to his diary, noting, “it seems as if the more pains you take the more the memory of the child recalcitrates against the admission of the idea into the mind.” Yet when JQA felt “exasperated at my Scholar’s dulness of apprehension,” he reminded himself that he had been trying to learn the Hebrew alphabet for “some forty odd years.”

JQA also mourned the death of his brother Thomas Boylston Adams (TBA), who died on 13 March 1832, and subsequently took a special interest in the care and support of TBA’s widow, Ann Harrod Adams (AHA), and their six children. In the fall of 1834 JQA received an even deeper blow. He learned that his son JA2 was in declining health. The young man was in Washington, D.C., overseeing his father’s investment in the Columbian Mills. He had suffered from a variety of health problems for several years, likely stemming from alcoholism. JQA rushed from Quincy to Washington, arriving on 22 October. The following day <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1834-10-23-p414">JQA recounted his son’s deathbed in his diary</a>: “At half past four I rose . . . and going into the bed-chamber where my Son lay, found” his uncle Nathaniel Frye “closing his eyes— He had just ceased to breathe. . . . Of the day from that time I have no distinct recollection— In a state between stupefaction, and a nervous irritation aggravated by the exertion to suppress it, the effort of my Soul was a deep, and earnest and unceasing supplication to God, for the Spirit and the will to fulfil all the duties devolving upon me, by this event.” After JA2’s death MCHA and her two daughters lived with LCA and JQA, who became the children’s legal guardian. Thus, JQA’s financial difficulties multiplied during this period, from both the failing Columbian Mills and his pecuniary duties toward TBA’s and JA2’s families.

Since graduating in 1787, JQA had maintained close ties with Harvard, and in 1830 he was elected to its Board of Overseers. He regularly attended meetings of the board when he was in Massachusetts. JQA refused, however, to take part in the conferring of an honorary degree on Andrew Jackson in 1833 during the president’s visit to Massachusetts, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1833-06-18-p090">noting in his diary:</a> “as myself an affectionate child of our alma Mater, I would not be present to witness her disgrace in conferring her highest Literary honours upon a barbarian, who could not write a sentence of Grammar, and hardly could spell his own name.”

<a class="image center" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/1207"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/81_360_g_ajackson_ref.jpg" alt="Andrew Jackson (1767–1845), engraving by J. B. Longacre." />Andrew Jackson (1767–1845), engraving by J. B. Longacre.</a>

In his leisure time, JQA continued his lifelong regimen of walking and swimming and spent hours in his garden. On <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v38-1830-11-27-p022">27 November 1830</a> he marveled that his land in Quincy was “now pregnant with at least ten thousand seeds of fruit and forest, mostly planted by my hand, and in a century from this day may bear timber for the floating Castles of my Country, and fruit for the subsistence health and comfort of my descendants.” From February to April 1831, still at loose ends before taking his congressional seat, JQA composed “Dermot MacMorrogh, or The Conquest of Ireland” while taking walks around Washington, D.C. The 2,000-line poem, first published in late 1832, met with lukewarm reception from reviewers.

JQA’s diary also records two vacations he took during these years: a ten-day trip to the White Mountains in New Hampshire in the late summer of 1833, and a short excursion to Harper’s Ferry in May 1834, traveling by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal with several other congressmen. JQA noted that he had <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1833-08-24-p122">“been much urged by my family to make” such trips “for change of air and Scene, to improve my health.”</a> His age was catching up with him; after spending a day making visits in Boston and Quincy in June 1833, the 66-year-old <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v39-1833-06-19-p090">“came home excessively wearied . . . Old age is stiffening my limbs, and fatigue is attended with lassitude, of which in youth I scarcely knew any thing but the name.”</a> And yet his dedication to the nation continued. After being elected to his third term in Congress in November 1834, JQA began 1835 knowing his life in service would continue at least through the sitting of the 24th Congress.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>September 1801 to July 1809: Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.</h2>
After seven years abroad, John Quincy Adams (JQA) returned to the United States in September 1801. Only 34 years old, he was already one of America’s most accomplished diplomats. During the next eight years he gained experience in Massachusetts and national politics, while also establishing himself as a lawyer and Harvard professor. Ostensibly a Federalist, he most often followed an independent political path. During this domestic interlude, between extensive European diplomatic tours, JQA cemented his reputation as a public servant who held what he perceived to be the national good above personal, regional, or party interests.

JQA reflected in his diary shortly after returning to the United States, <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1801-09-xx-p335">“My mode of life has . . . been altogether various.”</a> The next eight years proved to be equally “various.” Soon after his arrival he purchased a home in Boston and relaunched his legal career. He enjoyed ready access to the friends and family from whom he had been separated for so long and regularly visited his parents at Quincy, attended two religious services each Sunday, and met with other men at a Wednesday evening club. His family grew during this period, as eldest son George Washington Adams (GWA) was joined by John Adams (JA2) in July 1803 and Charles Francis Adams (CFA) in August 1807. His foreign-born wife, Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA) adjusted to a new life in the United States while suffering numerous and lengthy periods of poor health.

Within months of returning to Massachusetts, JQA accepted the first of a succession of public offices. In February 1802 he was appointed to the Massachusetts bankruptcy commission. Two months later he was elected to the state senate. In November, he narrowly lost an election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, remarking about his defeat, <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1802-11-03-p387">“I must consider the issue as relieving me from an heavy burden, and a thankless task.”</a> However, in February 1803, the Massachusetts legislature selected him as one of the state’s U.S. senators. He took his seat in October and for the next five years, JQA spent half his time in Washington, D.C. This period of public service proved contentious. The beginning of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe exacerbated political divisions in the United States. The Federalist Party that elected JQA expected him to represent the commercial interests of the Northeast. The Democratic-Republican Party controlled the national government with a majority in both houses of congress and Thomas Jefferson as president. The negotiation and purchase of Louisiana from France took place before JQA took his seat in the Senate. He did not oppose the purchase but attempted to introduce an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to provide for the expansion of new territory. His tacit acceptance of the purchase as important to the national good did not stand well with his Federalist constituents in Massachusetts. This was only one example of the independent stance he took as a senator. Perhaps most damning, in December 1807, he voted in favor of the embargo against European nations—particularly England and France—in retaliation for their aggression toward U.S. merchant ships. The act was extremely unpopular throughout New England, as it prevented American vessels from transporting their goods to overseas markets.

While his political stances frequently failed to find favor in Massachusetts, JQA’s reputation as a scholar led the Harvard Corporation to offer him the position of Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in June 1805. JQA commented on the appointment in his diary, declaring, <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v27-1805-06-26-p162">“The subject has been mentioned to me, several times in the course of the last three years— But I yet know not whether it will be proper or expedient for me to accept this situation.”</a> When JQA decided to accept the position, he successfully negotiated leave during the school term for the congressional sessions. His lectures proved to be only moderately popular; however, at the request of his students, the thirty-six lectures he delivered between 1806 and 1809 were published in 1810. Ever the scholar at heart, he noted in his diary: <a href="https://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-08-08-p130">“These lectures are the measure of my powers; moral and intellectual. . . . I shall never, unless by some special favour of Heaven, accomplish any Work of higher elevation.”</a>

By the end of 1807 JQA summarized his political position in his diary: <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v27-1807-12-xx-p321">“On most of the great national questions now under discussion, my sense of duty leads me to support the administration, and I find myself of course in opposition to the federalists in general.”</a> In January 1808 he even attended the Democratic-Republican caucus that met to select their next presidential candidate. In June of that year the Federalist-controlled Massachusetts legislature voted to replace him for the final year of his Senate term. JQA immediately resigned and temporarily returned to the status of a private citizen.

Outside of public service, his life was also complicated during these years. In April 1803 he learned that London bankers Bird, Savage, and Bird, a firm with whom he had resources invested along with much of his father John Adams’ (JA) money, had failed. Months earlier he had noted his concern in his diary when he did not receive an expected communication from the bankers; it left him <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v24-1802-09-18-p380">“in very distressing anxiety for my father’s property in their hands.”</a> On receiving word of the failure, JQA immediately began to sell property to protect his parents and maintain his financial reputation. He took stock of his finances at the end of September 1803: <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v27-1803-09-xx-p038">“The transition from the station and means of expence I had previously possessed, could not be agreeable; yet I found it less mortifying than might be expected, and easily reconciled my mind to it— I have practiced all the economy I thought practicable, but have needed still more.”</a> To further cut expenses, he sold his Hanover Street residence in Boston and moved his family to the small Quincy home in which he had been born.

<a class="image center" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/4190"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images/0647adamshouse1ref.jpg" alt="Birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, watercolor drawing by Eliza Susan Quincy, 1822" />Birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, watercolor drawing by Eliza Susan Quincy, 1822</a>

He achieved success as a lawyer during this period. He was active in the Massachusetts courts, but he also practiced before the U.S. Supreme Court. In the early nineteenth century, sitting U.S. senators could also represent clients at the nation’s highest court; this was both convenient and lucrative for JQA. After he resigned his senate seat, JQA divided his time between his Harvard obligations and his law practice. In February and early March 1809, he returned to the national capital to represent John Peck in the case of Fletcher v. Peck before the Supreme Court. While the court did not resolve the case in favor of his client until 1810, before he left Washington, D.C., newly-elected President James Madison presented him with a new diplomatic challenge.

On 6 March President Madison asked him to be the first U.S. Minister to Russia. When it appeared that the nomination would not receive senate confirmation, JQA returned to Boston and his legal and academic life. The Senate, however, finally confirmed his appointment to St. Petersburg on 27 June. Shortly after, he received his commission from Secretary of State Robert Smith. JQA accepted the post <a href="http://www.masshist.org/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v27-1809-07-05-p408">“with a deep sense of the stormy and dangerous career upon which I enter.”</a> He made plans to sail for Russia with LCA and CFA and arranged for GWA and JA2 to remain in Massachusetts to continue their education. The Adamses and their two eldest sons would soon be separated for almost six years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>March 1825 to December 1829: The Presidency and After</h2>
Inaugurated president of the United States on 4 March 1825, John Quincy Adams (JQA) entered the nation’s highest office at the pinnacle of his career after eight successful years as secretary of state. As president, JQA held a vision for the nation that was rooted in an ambitious reform plan, and he viewed himself as above party politics, the servant of the entire nation. The realities of his presidency, however, meant that his efforts to lead the nation in domestic and foreign policy issues were consistently thwarted by both partisan opposition and his steadfast commitment to principle.

<a class="image center" href="https://www.masshist.org/database/4190"><img src="https://www.masshist.org/database/images23/6470_ode_p1_work_ref.jpg" alt="Adams Ode. For the Fourth of March 1825" />Adams Ode. For the Fourth of March 1825</a>

The Era of Good Feelings that had characterized the previous decade of American politics devolved into a period of extreme partisanship during JQA’s presidency. Andrew Jackson and his supporters, convinced that the 1824 presidential election had been stolen via the “corrupt bargain,” stymied JQA’s administration whenever possible. Only three days after taking the oath of office, JQA recognized that the opposition in Congress would be his bane. Although most of his cabinet nominations were unanimously approved by the Senate, Henry Clay’s for secretary of state proved an exception. The opposition blamed Clay in large part for Adams’ election. When the Senate confirmed Clay’s appointment by a vote of 27 to 14, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v33-1825-03-07-p101">JQA correctly recognized this as “the first act of the opposition from the stump, which is to be carried on against the Administration, under the banners of General Jackson.”</a> Almost immediately, the brutal campaign for the 1828 presidential election opened. And, by winning control of the House of Representatives in the 1826 mid-term elections, the Jacksonians gained enough power to make the second half of JQA’s term even more troublesome. Throughout his presidency, sectionalism and states’ rights conflicts exacerbated the partisanship.

JQA’s unwavering resolution to place personal principles above party priorities further impeded his success. As president, JQA had numerous posts to fill, and he could remove officeholders who served at his pleasure, but he refused to replace qualified civil servants with his own political supporters. Members of his cabinet urged the president to dismiss men who were not loyal to the administration, especially those who were openly hostile. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v33-1825-05-13-p139">JQA stood firm. “To answer merely that it was the pleasure of the President, would be harsh and odious,” and, he continued, “inconsistent with the principle upon which I have commenced the Administration, of removing no person from Office, but for cause.”</a> His refusal to consider patronage appointments plagued him during his four years in the White House. JQA estimated that 80 percent of the custom house officers throughout the union opposed his election. Postmaster General John McLean, a notoriously outspoken member of the opposition, retained his office during JQA’s entire administration because he proved to be a good and talented public servant. This scrupulous stance was a marked contrast to the “spoils system” implemented by Andrew Jackson in 1829, where long-serving public officials were swept out and replaced by loyal partisans. Jackson’s approach, which included McLean’s appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, galled JQA. “The appointments almost without exception are conferred upon the vilest purveyors of Slander during the late electioneering campaign,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36-1829-04-16-p151">he wrote a year after leaving office.</a>

While many of JQA’s contemporaries identified him as a New England man, JQA was a nationalist. His plans for the economy, which included federal support for internal improvements, like canals, roads, and bridges, coincided with what became known as Henry Clay’s “American System.” JQA’s national vision went beyond these basic improvements. In his first annual message to Congress in December 1825, despite advice from his cabinet, the president called for a national university, an astronomical observatory, and the creation of a Department of the Interior—none of which were approved during his term. The notorious Tariff of 1828, popularly known as the “Tariff of Abominations,” was related to the economic nationalism of his administration. JQA, who makes only passing reference to it in his diary, was not an enthusiastic supporter, but he did sign the tariff into law, igniting an extreme sectional issue that the opposition used to strengthen its hold on the South. This sectional and partisan divide erupted in the fight between the federal government and the state of Georgia over Indian removal.

As a result of settlers’ increasing desire to inhabit Indian lands, treaties between the United States or individual states and Native American tribes during the 1820s mandated the transfer of land from the tribes in return for monetary payments. In the 1825 Treaty of Indian Springs, a minor band of the Creek tribe signed away the tribe’s land in western Georgia. The majority of the tribe refused to recognize the agreement, and the Creeks appealed to the federal government to protect them from the unjust treaty. Their appeal led to a new treaty that was more favorable to the Creek nation. In January 1826 the Treaty of Indian Springs was nullified as fraudulent, and JQA negotiated a new agreement, the Treaty of Washington, which ceded less Creek land than the previous treaty. In response, Georgia governor George Troup continued preparations for the tribe’s removal by sending state surveyors onto Creek land. When the Native Americans defended their rights and threatened the surveyors, Troup responded by ordering state troops onto Indian lands. The governor’s actions created a dilemma for JQA at the start of 1827. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v50-1827-01-27-p019">Though the president had “no doubt of the right” to send federal troops</a> to Georgia to protect the Creeks,” he questioned “the expediency of so doing . . . To send troops against them must end in acts of violence.” JQA believed this <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v50-1827-02-02-p032">clash of federal versus states’ rights threatened “a dissolution of the Union,”</a> an outcome that was avoided through another treaty. As part of the Treaty of Indian Agency, concluded in November 1827, the Creeks ceded their remaining lands in return for approximately $42,000.

Foreign relations, JQA’s area of greatest experience and renown, proved no more successful during his presidency than his domestic plans. The most remarkable failure, again largely the result of partisan and sectional opposition, concerned the 1826 Pan-American conference held in Panama. South American liberator Simón Bolívar called the meeting to discuss plans for common security in light of European threats to regain control over the former Spanish colonies. Both JQA and Secretary of State Clay believed U.S. participation would be essential to cement relations with the newly independent nations—especially for commercial reasons. This was a natural extension of the Monroe Doctrine, in which JQA helped establish a foreign policy that recognized the independence of these countries and warned against attempts by the European powers to reassert their authority in them. Congressional approval of funds for U.S. participation was delayed so long by partisan bickering that the conference ended before the American delegate arrived.

Halfway through his term <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v50-1827-03-05-p058">the burden of partisan and sectional conflicts</a> bore down on JQA. “I can scarcely conceive a more harassing, wearying, teazing condition of existence . . . the weight grows heavier from day to day.” JQA had little hope that he would be reelected in 1828, and as the political mudslinging intensified, he seemed more concerned for his reputation than achieving a second term. The Jacksonian press, especially the Richmond Enquirer, attacked the president at every opportunity. “A combination of parties, and of public men, against my character and reputation such as I believe never before was exhibited against any man since this Union existed,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36i-1829-02-xx-p129">JQA later observed</a>. Eighteen months before the election <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v37-1827-05-13-p185">he conceded to himself: “My own Career is closed— My hopes such as are left to me, are centered upon my children.” On 3 December 1828, Jackson won a landslide victory with 178 to JQA’s 83 electoral votes.</a>

JQA did not attend Jackson’s inauguration. He described his own <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36i-1829-03-05-p161">transition from public to private life, “like an instantaneous flat calm in the midst of a Hurricane.”</a> A month into the new administration, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36-1829-04-04-p151">he assessed Jackson’s cabinet</a>. “Among them all there is not a man capable of a generous or liberal Sentiment towards an Adversary,” except John Henry Eaton, “and he is a man of indecently licentious life— They have made themselves my adversaries, solely for their own advancement, and have forfeited the characters of gentlemen, to indulge the bitterness of their self-stirred gall.” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36-1829-11-29-p290">Thomas Hart Benton had the principles “of a highway robber,”</a> Martin Van Buren “those of a dirty intriguer,” and John C. Calhoun’s actions were “mere prostitution to popularity.”

As an escape from the myriad duties that consumed JQA’s time during his presidency, he sought to maintain some of the diversions of private life: exercise, reading, and relaxation. During the first year of his presidency, he maintained a vigorous regimen of swimming and walking. Normally a careful person concerned with protecting his health, JQA continually challenged himself to swim farther and longer. After he nearly drowned in a June 1825 accident, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v33-1825-06-13-p173">he admitted, “This incident gave me a humiliating lesson, and solemn warning not to trifle with danger.”</a> He continued more moderate swimming in hot weather, both in Washington, D.C., and when he returned to Massachusetts. In cold weather he walked, usually in the early morning around Capital Square, and in 1828 and 1829 he frequently rode horseback.

When his social commitments allowed, the president spent his evenings reading, usually commentaries on the Bible, histories, or works from the ancient world such as those by Tacitus and Cicero. He also sought relaxing hobbies, recording frequent references to playing billiards, an innocuous diversion the opposition turned into campaign fodder when they accused JQA, without merit, of being extravagant with public funds because he purchased a billiards table. In the second half of his presidency, JQA’s passion as an arborist surpassed all other pastimes. His interest in the topic was reflected in his reading and in his health regime, where some of his exercise took the form of “garden walks.” To some extent his interest in planting and propagating trees became an escape from the political world.

The family’s personal circumstances added to JQA’s burdens during this period. Sixteen months into his term, and in the midst of the failed attempt to secure timely appropriations for the delegation to the Panama conference, JQA received word of his father’s decline and imminent death. On 8 July 1826, while en route to Quincy, he learned of the former president’s passing on 4 July. JQA arrived in Quincy on 13 July. “I was not fully sensible of the change till I entered his bed-chamber, the place where I had last taken leave of him,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v35-1826-07-13-p323">JQA reflected. “That moment was inexpressively painful, and struck me as if it had been an arrow to the heart.”</a> His grief was coupled with duty. As JA’s primary beneficiary and one of the estate’s executors, he had extensive work to do to fulfill his father’s wishes regarding bequests. During the next four years, he spent lengthy periods in Massachusetts. He oversaw and assisted with surveys of property he now owned in and around Quincy. He worked to <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v35-1826-09-22-p385">fulfill his father’s wish that funds from the estate be employed for “the Establishment of a School or Academy, for the preparatory Education of youth for the University.”</a> He devoted close attention to the construction of the “Stone Temple” in Quincy, which would contain the tomb and memorial plaque for his father and mother. He took it upon himself to preserve and organize the family’s papers and to write a memoir or biography of JA’s life. The papers were preserved; however, the memoir remained unfinished.

These final duties to his father took place amid the relentless challenges of his presidency and constant concern for his family. His wife, Louisa Catherine (LCA), continued to suffer from bouts of poor health, and in 1828 he begrudgingly accepted the marriage of his son John Adams (JA2) and Mary Catherine Hellen (MCHA), a cousin who had lived in the Adams household for several years. The following year, tragedy struck again with the death of his eldest son, George Washington Adams (GWA).

Word reached JQA on 2 May 1829 that GWA had been lost from the steamboat Franklin during its passage from Providence, Rhode Island, to New York, sometime during the night of 30 April. The news stunned JQA, even though he knew that GWA was troubled. In the fall of 1826, JQA had concluded <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v35-1826-09-23-p385">after a long conversation with his son: “His heart is pure; but his imagination outruns his judgment, his ambition is ardent, and his temper tending too much to despondency; to which his present feeble state of health contributes.”</a> Information JQA gleaned from another Franklin passenger indicated that GWA had become delusional and paranoid during the passage. When his son’s body was recovered in June, JQA traveled to New York to arrange for the disposition of the remains. Afterwards he continued to Quincy where he stayed until December.

Youngest son Charles Francis Adams (CFA) provided one of the few happy family occasions during these years; the young Boston lawyer wed Abigail Brown Brooks (ABA) in September 1829. JQA’s beloved library continued to provide respite. In addition to continuing the family work he had begun in 1826, JQA gathered most of his books in one place for the first time. Included in the renovations of the family’s home at Peacefield, which he believed would be his permanent retirement residence, was extensive shelving for his library. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36-1829-11-29-p290">In time his “design was to build in my yard a small Office of Stone, which I might use for a Library and Study.”</a> Despite being occupied in personal and family business, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v36-1829-11-18-p290">he adjusted poorly to private life. “I distress myself with the consciousness that my few hours of remaining life are slipping away from me unimproved— That my occupations are engrossed for transitory purposes, and that I am losing day after day without atchieving any thing.”</a> JQA found retirement unfulfilling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>January 1835 to December 1838</h2>
It was during this period of his congressional service that John Quincy Adams (JQA) earned the sobriquet “Old Man Eloquent” for his oratory in the United States House of Representatives. Adams continued to be one of the most respected and influential members of that body, regularly speaking on the controversial issues of the day, including the future of slavery and the annexation of Texas. He also advocated for national scientific and cultural advancement through the creation of the Smithsonian Institution.

From 1835 to 1838, Representative Adams regularly presented antislavery petitions in the House. The majority of these petitions were not, however, requests from constituents in his home district in Massachusetts. As Adams’ reputation for presenting such documents grew, he began to receive petitions from men and women across the United States. These petitions often led to debates over whether they should be received or tabled by the House.

The First Amendment prevented Congress from abridging the rights of Americans “to petition the Government for a redress of grievance,” but in May 1836 a House committee presented a way around this principle when it introduced a resolution that would table all petitions relating to slavery. During the debate on this proposed “gag rule,” JQA sought the floor, but the Speaker of the House James K. Polk refused to recognize him. The House then proceeded to a roll-call vote on the resolution that would silence its members by refusing to formally receive antislavery petitions. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v48-1836-05-26-p557">Adams recorded his outrage in his diary</a>: “On my name’s being called . . . I answered I hold the Resolution to be a direct violation of the Constitution of the United States—of the Rules of this House and of the rights of my Constituents.” Following the vote, JQA moved to a new phase in his quest to preserve the First Amendment against the onslaught from the southern slavocracy.

Along with his fight against the Gag Rule, JQA opposed the annexation of the republic of Texas. While he had long been an advocate of U.S. territorial expansion, Adams realized that the nation’s delicate sectional balance of power would tip when Texas entered the union as a slave state. Adams read newspaper accounts of the Texas declaration of independence on 2 March 1836 and about the defeat of Texan forces at the battle of the Alamo. When Congress voted to request that President Andrew Jackson send a volunteer militia to assist the Texans, Adams was one of the few congressmen to oppose the measure. His efforts continued during the next presidential administration, and his greatest accomplishment on this issue was a speech that he began on 16 June 1838 and continued during the morning hour of the House’s daily sessions until 7 July. JQA’s long speech, ostensibly against Texas annexation, was also a denunciation of the evils of slavery in American society. Adams’ argument helped persuade President Martin Van Buren to postpone the annexation. JQA subsequently used his notes from the speech to draft a 131-page pamphlet that was printed and widely distributed.

As the next congressional session began in January 1837, the Gag Rule was reintroduced and again passed in the House. Adams, however, continued to present the antislavery petitions he received from across the country. His dislike of the institution of slavery and his belief in the inviolability of the First Amendment led him on 6 February to present what he knew to be a fraudulent petition, supposedly drafted by a group of enslaved individuals. Upon Adams’ presentation of this petition, southern congressmen drafted a resolution of censure against him. Three days later Adams took to the House floor to defend the right of petition. In the end the vote of censure against him failed. His focus on the issue was so total that no diary entries are extant from mid-February to the end of March 1837, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v33-1837-03-30-p229">prompting Adams to comment that it was</a> “the first time for more than forty years” that he had “suffered a total breach in my Diary for several weeks— At one of the most trying periods of my life— The Journals of the House of Representatives of the United States . . . must supply the vacancy.”

Abolitionists lauded John Quincy Adams for his actions, though he did not consider himself a member of their movement. Adams did not relish his role in taking up the antislavery mantle in Congress, yet he believed there was no one else to do it. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v33-1837-09-01-p299">He recorded in his diary</a> that his involvement with this national issue troubled his family, who “exercise all the influence they possess to restrain and divert me from all connection with the abolitionists, and with their cause.” Caught between his beliefs and his family, Adams stated that “my mind is agitated almost to distraction,” and noted that his own congressional district “is convulsed between the Slavery and abolition questions, and I walk on this edge of a precipice in every step that I take.”

When the 25th Congress convened in December 1837, a new version of the Gag Rule again passed in the House. “When my name was called,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v48-1837-12-21-p701">JQA recorded of the vote</a>, “I answered I hold the Resolution to be a Violation of the Constitution of the right of petition of my constituents and of the people of the United States, and of my right to freedom of Speech as a member of this House— I said this amidst a perfect war whoop of order.” The House renewed the Gag Rule in each session until 1844, and Adams continued to protest the practice of preventing the right of petition, unrelenting in presenting the antislavery petitions he received.

Beyond his stance in Congress, John Quincy Adams learned more about the horrors of slavery through his personal involvement in the cause of Dorcas Allen. Allen was an African-American woman who, though promised emancipation multiple times by her enslavers, did not possess the documents she needed to legally secure her freedom—even though she had been living freely in the District of Columbia for several years. In 1837 Allen and her four children were sold to a slave trader and taken to a slave pen in Alexandria, Virginia. There, Allen murdered the youngest two children and tried to kill the elder two and take her own life. She was tried for murder, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was found not guilty by a jury. After the trial her current enslaver sought to sell Dorcas and her two surviving children; her husband, a free black man named Nathaniel Allen, tried to buy them but had trouble raising the necessary funds to complete the purchase. Adams read about Dorcas Allen’s plight in newspapers, visited her and the children at a slave auction house, and pledged $50 toward the Allens’ freedom. At the end of 1838 <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v33-1838-12-13-p671">Adams offered frank commentary on slavery</a>: “The conflict between the principle of liberty, and the fact of Slavery is coming gradually to an issue. . . . That the fall of Slavery, is predetermined in the counsels of omnipotence, I cannot doubt. . . . But the conflict will be terrible, and the progress of improvement perhaps retrograde before its final progress to consummation.”

The other national issue that consumed JQA during these years was the fate of the Smithson bequest. In December 1835 President Jackson notified Congress that an Englishman named James Smithson had left $500,000 to the United States in his will. “A stranger to this Country, knowing it only by its history,” <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v40-1836-01-10-p151">JQA commented on the unusual bequest in his diary</a>, “that he should be the man to found . . . an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, is an event in which I see the finger of Providence compassing great results by incomprehensible means.” The House created a special nine-member committee to report on the bequest, with Adams as its chair. In July 1836 the House took up the resulting bill, which stated that the U.S. government would apply the bequest to the founding and endowment of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, D.C. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v33-1838-10-06-p613">Adams, however, worried</a> that “this excellent donation will be degraded into a pack of electioneering jobs,” frittered away by the government rather than being held together to create such an institution. As the struggle to found the institution dragged on, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v33-1838-06-24-p507">he spoke with President Martin Van Buren</a>: “I urged upon him the deep responsibility of the Nation to the world, and to all posterity worthily to fulfil the great object of the Testator— I only lament my inability to communicate half the solicitude, with which my heart is on this subject full.” While Adams personally would have preferred the funds spent on constructing an astronomical observatory, above all he wanted the bequest to go toward the creation of an American research institution.

JQA and LCA welcomed two additional grandchildren into their family during this period: Charles Francis Adams (CFA2) was born on 27 May 1835 and Henry Adams (HA), the future writer and historian, was born on 16 February 1838. As he moved into his seventies, JQA became increasingly close to his only surviving child, Charles Francis Adams (CFA). <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/document/jqadiaries-v40-1835-06-19-p001">He regularly sought his son’s counsel on financial matters and family issues, noting</a>, “all my hopes of futurity in this world are now centered upon him.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>August 1809 to August 1817</h2>
John Quincy Adams (JQA) resumed his diplomatic duties in 1809 when he traveled to St. Petersburg as the United States’ first minister plenipotentiary to Russia. He went from there to Ghent, Belgium, in 1814, where he led the American peace delegation to end the War of 1812. He then spent two years in England as the U.S. minister at the Court of St. James before returning to the United States in August 1817. During these eight years abroad, JQA gained a reputation as a tenacious and able diplomat.

When JQA sailed from Boston on 5 August 1809 with his wife Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA) and youngest son Charles Francis Adams (CFA), almost two, they left behind their two older sons, George Washington Adams (GWA), age eight, and John Adams (JA2), age six, to continue their education in the United States. The family would not reunite until 1815. JQA claimed the decision to accept the diplomatic commission <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1809-08-06-p001">“neither suits my own inclination, nor my own private judgment, I deem it a duty to sacrifice them both to public sense.”</a> LCA’s younger sister Catherine Maria Frances Johnson accompanied her as a companion; JQA’s nephew, William Steuben Smith, and two other young Massachusetts men, Francis Calley Grey and Alexander Hill Everett, comprised the legation staff. After a tedious and sometimes dangerous voyage, the American minister and his family and staff reached St. Petersburg on 23 October.

<a class="image center"><img src="/publications/jqadiaries/images/diary49_page490.jpg" alt="John Quincy Adams’ drawing of Helsingborg Tower, 1 October 1809, page 490 of Diary 49" />John Quincy Adams’ drawing of Helsingborg Tower, 1 October 1809, page 490 of Diary 49</a>

Priding himself on his republican principles, JQA complained regularly about court life and society at St. Petersburg and chafed at the obligatory social commitments associated with his post: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1809-11-04-p031">“It is not safe or prudent to despise them; nor practicable for a person of rational understanding to value them.”</a> Compared to the American minister, most European diplomats had vast resources and entertained lavishly. Obliged to attend splendid parties, JQA was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-01-14-p063">“reduced to the necessity of dancing, to avoid gambling at Cards.”</a> He mentioned several instances when he rejected gifts that were offered to him or members of the family: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-06-25-p113">“Under the Circumstances in which I find myself here it is difficult to resist the opportunities thus presented for anticipating upon my regular income— But I am determined to do it.”</a>

Domestic life during the years in Russia was trying for the minister and his wife. Corruption and thievery plagued their household. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-12-17-p183">“It is I believe the law of Nature . . . that the Servant shall spoil or plunder the Master— In this Country at least it is universal usage— It requires the most constant and minute attention to keep this pilfering within tolerable bounds.”</a> Likely prompted by dishonest merchants and servants, JQA became increasingly engaged <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-07-08-p121">“in the labyrinth of enquiries concerning weights &amp; measures.”</a> It was an obsession that served him well in the following decade when, as secretary of state, the U.S. Senate tasked him with preparing a report on weights and measures, which he completed on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v31-1821-02-22-p508#sn=5">22 February 1821.</a>

Family matters also weighed on JQA during his time in St. Petersburg. On 12 August 1811, JQA and LCA’s only daughter Louisa Catherine Adams was born. The child died a little over a year later, in September 1812, after contracting dysentery. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1812-09-15-p410">“Her last moments were distressing to me and to her mother, beyond expression,”</a> JQA wrote of his and LCA’s devastating grief. Only a few months later, JQA had to have <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1813-01-18-p444">“a long and very serious conversation”</a> with his nephew William Steuben Smith about the intimate relationship he had with Catherine Johnson. Smith <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1813-01-18-p444">“finally avowed a disposition to do right,”</a> and the couple married in February 1813.

Europe remained at war during JQA’s tenure in Russia. His diplomatic activities most often concerned the protection of American commerce. The shifting alliances, generated by Napoleon Bonaparte’s imperial expansion, tested him. He gained the respect of the Russian emperor Alexander I and St. Petersburg’s diplomatic community. The French ambassador, Armand Augustine Louis de Caulaincourt, Duc de Vicence, acknowledged JQA as one of the <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1811-02-15-p205">“great favorites here— You have found powerful protection.”</a> In June 1812, two significant international events shifted his diplomatic focus: the United States declared war on Great Britain and France invaded Russia in retaliation for its refusal to support the Continental System and as a means to control Poland. JQA later played an important role in ending the conflict that became known as the War of 1812; in the meantime, he and his family, from the relative safety of St. Petersburg, followed reports about the French occupation of Moscow, the war of attrition fought by the Russians, and the subsequent French retreat later that year.

<a class="image center"><img src="/publications/jqadiaries/images/7536_alexandre_work.jpg" alt="Emperor Alexander I of Russia" />Emperor Alexander I of Russia</a>

The United States and Great Britain fought over a number of issues, including British impressment of American seamen and British support for Native Americans in conflict with the United States. As the War of 1812 dragged on, Alexander I offered to mediate between the two nations in 1813. When nothing came of the offer, the American delegation that now included Albert Gallatin and James Bayard moved to Ghent to negotiate directly with the British peace commissioners. JQA was appointed to head the commission in January 1814. The same day he left St. Petersburg to join the American delegates, word arrived in the Russian capital of Napoleon’s abdication and exile to Elba. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-04-28-p082">“With this prospect of a general Peace in Europe, I commenced my Journey, to contribute if possible to the restoration of Peace to my own Country.”</a> Henry Clay and Jonathan Russell also joined the American commission that negotiated through the summer and fall of 1814. Issues, including the Canadian-United States boundary, commercial restrictions, fishing rights, and compensation for slaves taken by the British, prolonged the peace process. JQA also recognized that the priorities of the American commissioners differed—frequently as a result of their regional loyalties. He found Clay to be the most acrimonious, once noting that the Kentuckian <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-28-p163">“lost his temper, as he generally does whenever this right of the British to navigate”</a> the Mississippi River was debated. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-28-p163">“He was utterly averse to admitting it as an equivalent for a stipulation securing the contested part of the Fisheries.”</a>

As head of the American delegation, JQA drafted most of the written exchanges with their British counterparts. His fellow American commissioners reviewed and edited the drafts. As early as 10 November, JQA included a <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“proposal to conclude the Peace on the footing of the State before the war, applied to all the subjects of dispute between the two Countries, leaving all the rest for future and pacific Negotiation.”</a> His fellow American delegates rejected most of JQA’s draft, including that section, arguing that such a statement offered Britain too many concessions; Clay adamantly stated that he <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“would concede no more.”</a> JQA, however, contended that the American government <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“would now gladly take the State before the War as the general basis of the Peace,”</a> that he was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“prepared to take on . . . the responsibility”</a> of explaining the proposal to the United States, and that he <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“would at this moment cheerfully give my life, for a Peace on this basis.”</a> Despite the internal opposition, “status quo ante bellum” was in fact the basis of the peace agreement that both commissions signed on Christmas Eve 1814 as the Treaty of Ghent. When JQA left Ghent for Paris at the end of January 1815, he concluded, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-01-26-p206">“My residence in the City has been of seven Months and two days, and it has been the most memorable period of my life.”</a>

LCA and CFA remained at St. Petersburg when JQA traveled to the Ghent peace negotiations. He wrote to LCA three days after the conclusion of the treaty inviting her to come and join him. He received her answer on 16 January 1815, informing him that <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-02-16-p217">“She will come as soon as possible, and will I hope be here in the course of a Month.”</a> LCA did not leave St. Petersburg until 12 February and arrived at Paris forty days later. Her overland trek not only took place in winter but at the very time Napoleon returned from exile. Several years later she recalled that dangerous adventure in a memoir, “Narrative of a Journey from Russia to France.” The Adamses remained in Paris for two more months, during which time JQA feasted on theater productions, a life-long pleasure, though one he described as <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-03-xx-p229">“A fearful waste of time.”</a>

On 28 February 1815 JQA was appointed as U.S. minister plenipotentiary to Great Britain, a post his father, John Adams, had also held. In May, JQA traveled with LCA and CFA from Paris to London. Shortly after reaching the British capital, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-05-25-p247">“We found our dear sons whom we had not seen for nearly six years”</a>; GWA and JA2 had just arrived from America. In August the family moved to the village of Ealing about seven miles from London. The near two-year tenure at “Little Boston”—the most appropriate name of the house they rented—may have been the happiest time of JQA’s adult life. He enrolled the younger boys in a local boarding school and personally oversaw GWA’s studies. The family socialized with merchants, clergy, and scholars in the local community. Although he was obligated to attend court functions and other diplomatic events, JQA admitted, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1816-04-04-p420">“one of my strongest reasons for remaining out of town, is to escape from the frequency of invitations at late hours, which consume so much precious time.”</a> He went to London several times each week and walked much of the way. During these walks, he frequently composed verses. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1816-10-16-p080">“Could I have chosen my own Genius and Condition I should have made myself a great Poet”</a>; however, he realized that he was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1816-10-16-p080">“spell-bound in the circle of mediocrity.”</a>

To fulfill his diplomatic duties, JQA met frequently with Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary. Their discussions most often concerned attempts to resolve lingering issues left unsettled at Ghent—the Atlantic slave trade and how to improve commercial relations. In a separate negotiation, Adams, with Henry Clay and Albert Gallatin, concluded a minor trade agreement with a British commission in 1815.

In early December 1816, JQA learned that the newly-elected president, James Monroe, would likely proffer <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1816-12-05-p104">“the Office of Secretary of State to me.”</a> A letter arrived on 16 April 1817 from the president, officially offering the post to JQA. He wrote the next day to accept. On 15 May the family sailed for the United States aboard the ship Washington, landing at New York on 6 August. The journey was completed when JQA arrived at Quincy <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1817-08-18-p237">“and had the inexpressible happiness of finding my dear and venerable father and mother in perfect health.”</a>

<h2>August 1809 to August 1817</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Quincy Adams (JQA) resumed his diplomatic duties in 1809 when he traveled to St. Petersburg as the United States’ first minister plenipotentiary to Russia. He went from there to Ghent, Belgium, in 1814, where he led the American peace delegation to end the War of 1812. He then spent two years in England as the U.S. minister at the Court of St. James before returning to the United States in August 1817. During these eight years abroad, JQA gained a reputation as a tenacious and able diplomat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When JQA sailed from Boston on 5 August 1809 with his wife Louisa Catherine Adams (LCA) and youngest son Charles Francis Adams (CFA), almost two, they left behind their two older sons, George Washington Adams (GWA), age eight, and John Adams (JA2), age six, to continue their education in the United States. The family would not reunite until 1815. JQA claimed the decision to accept the diplomatic commission <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1809-08-06-p001">“neither suits my own inclination, nor my own private judgment, I deem it a duty to sacrifice them both to public sense.”</a> LCA’s younger sister Catherine Maria Frances Johnson accompanied her as a companion; JQA’s nephew, William Steuben Smith, and two other young Massachusetts men, Francis Calley Grey and Alexander Hill Everett, comprised the legation staff. After a tedious and sometimes dangerous voyage, the American minister and his family and staff reached St. Petersburg on 23 October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="http://192.168.56.57/jqa/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/diary49_page490.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-590"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a class="image center">John Quincy Adams’ drawing of Helsingborg Tower, 1 October 1809, page 490 of Diary 49</a></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Priding himself on his republican principles, JQA complained regularly about court life and society at St. Petersburg and chafed at the obligatory social commitments associated with his post: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1809-11-04-p031">“It is not safe or prudent to despise them; nor practicable for a person of rational understanding to value them.”</a> Compared to the American minister, most European diplomats had vast resources and entertained lavishly. Obliged to attend splendid parties, JQA was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-01-14-p063">“reduced to the necessity of dancing, to avoid gambling at Cards.”</a> He mentioned several instances when he rejected gifts that were offered to him or members of the family: <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-06-25-p113">“Under the Circumstances in which I find myself here it is difficult to resist the opportunities thus presented for anticipating upon my regular income— But I am determined to do it.”</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Domestic life during the years in Russia was trying for the minister and his wife. Corruption and thievery plagued their household. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-12-17-p183">“It is I believe the law of Nature . . . that the Servant shall spoil or plunder the Master— In this Country at least it is universal usage— It requires the most constant and minute attention to keep this pilfering within tolerable bounds.”</a> Likely prompted by dishonest merchants and servants, JQA became increasingly engaged <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1810-07-08-p121">“in the labyrinth of enquiries concerning weights &amp; measures.”</a> It was an obsession that served him well in the following decade when, as secretary of state, the U.S. Senate tasked him with preparing a report on weights and measures, which he completed on <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v31-1821-02-22-p508#sn=5">22 February 1821.</a></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family matters also weighed on JQA during his time in St. Petersburg. On 12 August 1811, JQA and LCA’s only daughter Louisa Catherine Adams was born. The child died a little over a year later, in September 1812, after contracting dysentery. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1812-09-15-p410">“Her last moments were distressing to me and to her mother, beyond expression,”</a> JQA wrote of his and LCA’s devastating grief. Only a few months later, JQA had to have <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1813-01-18-p444">“a long and very serious conversation”</a> with his nephew William Steuben Smith about the intimate relationship he had with Catherine Johnson. Smith <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1813-01-18-p444">“finally avowed a disposition to do right,”</a> and the couple married in February 1813.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Europe remained at war during JQA’s tenure in Russia. His diplomatic activities most often concerned the protection of American commerce. The shifting alliances, generated by Napoleon Bonaparte’s imperial expansion, tested him. He gained the respect of the Russian emperor Alexander I and St. Petersburg’s diplomatic community. The French ambassador, Armand Augustine Louis de Caulaincourt, Duc de Vicence, acknowledged JQA as one of the <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v28-1811-02-15-p205">“great favorites here— You have found powerful protection.”</a> In June 1812, two significant international events shifted his diplomatic focus: the United States declared war on Great Britain and France invaded Russia in retaliation for its refusal to support the Continental System and as a means to control Poland. JQA later played an important role in ending the conflict that became known as the War of 1812; in the meantime, he and his family, from the relative safety of St. Petersburg, followed reports about the French occupation of Moscow, the war of attrition fought by the Russians, and the subsequent French retreat later that year.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="http://192.168.56.57/jqa/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/7536_alexandre_work.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-586"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a>Emperor Alexander I of Russia</a></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The United States and Great Britain fought over a number of issues, including British impressment of American seamen and British support for Native Americans in conflict with the United States. As the War of 1812 dragged on, Alexander I offered to mediate between the two nations in 1813. When nothing came of the offer, the American delegation that now included Albert Gallatin and James Bayard moved to Ghent to negotiate directly with the British peace commissioners. JQA was appointed to head the commission in January 1814. The same day he left St. Petersburg to join the American delegates, word arrived in the Russian capital of Napoleon’s abdication and exile to Elba. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-04-28-p082">“With this prospect of a general Peace in Europe, I commenced my Journey, to contribute if possible to the restoration of Peace to my own Country.”</a> Henry Clay and Jonathan Russell also joined the American commission that negotiated through the summer and fall of 1814. Issues, including the Canadian-United States boundary, commercial restrictions, fishing rights, and compensation for slaves taken by the British, prolonged the peace process. JQA also recognized that the priorities of the American commissioners differed—frequently as a result of their regional loyalties. He found Clay to be the most acrimonious, once noting that the Kentuckian <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-28-p163">“lost his temper, as he generally does whenever this right of the British to navigate”</a> the Mississippi River was debated. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-28-p163">“He was utterly averse to admitting it as an equivalent for a stipulation securing the contested part of the Fisheries.”</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As head of the American delegation, JQA drafted most of the written exchanges with their British counterparts. His fellow American commissioners reviewed and edited the drafts. As early as 10 November, JQA included a <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“proposal to conclude the Peace on the footing of the State before the war, applied to all the subjects of dispute between the two Countries, leaving all the rest for future and pacific Negotiation.”</a> His fellow American delegates rejected most of JQA’s draft, including that section, arguing that such a statement offered Britain too many concessions; Clay adamantly stated that he <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“would concede no more.”</a> JQA, however, contended that the American government <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“would now gladly take the State before the War as the general basis of the Peace,”</a> that he was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“prepared to take on . . . the responsibility”</a> of explaining the proposal to the United States, and that he <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1814-11-10-p163">“would at this moment cheerfully give my life, for a Peace on this basis.”</a> Despite the internal opposition, “status quo ante bellum” was in fact the basis of the peace agreement that both commissions signed on Christmas Eve 1814 as the Treaty of Ghent. When JQA left Ghent for Paris at the end of January 1815, he concluded, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-01-26-p206">“My residence in the City has been of seven Months and two days, and it has been the most memorable period of my life.”</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LCA and CFA remained at St. Petersburg when JQA traveled to the Ghent peace negotiations. He wrote to LCA three days after the conclusion of the treaty inviting her to come and join him. He received her answer on 16 January 1815, informing him that <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-02-16-p217">“She will come as soon as possible, and will I hope be here in the course of a Month.”</a> LCA did not leave St. Petersburg until 12 February and arrived at Paris forty days later. Her overland trek not only took place in winter but at the very time Napoleon returned from exile. Several years later she recalled that dangerous adventure in a memoir, “Narrative of a Journey from Russia to France.” The Adamses remained in Paris for two more months, during which time JQA feasted on theater productions, a life-long pleasure, though one he described as <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-03-xx-p229">“A fearful waste of time.”</a></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On 28 February 1815 JQA was appointed as U.S. minister plenipotentiary to Great Britain, a post his father, John Adams, had also held. In May, JQA traveled with LCA and CFA from Paris to London. Shortly after reaching the British capital, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1815-05-25-p247">“We found our dear sons whom we had not seen for nearly six years”</a>; GWA and JA2 had just arrived from America. In August the family moved to the village of Ealing about seven miles from London. The near two-year tenure at “Little Boston”—the most appropriate name of the house they rented—may have been the happiest time of JQA’s adult life. He enrolled the younger boys in a local boarding school and personally oversaw GWA’s studies. The family socialized with merchants, clergy, and scholars in the local community. Although he was obligated to attend court functions and other diplomatic events, JQA admitted, <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v29-1816-04-04-p420">“one of my strongest reasons for remaining out of town, is to escape from the frequency of invitations at late hours, which consume so much precious time.”</a> He went to London several times each week and walked much of the way. During these walks, he frequently composed verses. <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1816-10-16-p080">“Could I have chosen my own Genius and Condition I should have made myself a great Poet”</a>; however, he realized that he was <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1816-10-16-p080">“spell-bound in the circle of mediocrity.”</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To fulfill his diplomatic duties, JQA met frequently with Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary. Their discussions most often concerned attempts to resolve lingering issues left unsettled at Ghent—the Atlantic slave trade and how to improve commercial relations. In a separate negotiation, Adams, with Henry Clay and Albert Gallatin, concluded a minor trade agreement with a British commission in 1815.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In early December 1816, JQA learned that the newly-elected president, James Monroe, would likely proffer <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1816-12-05-p104">“the Office of Secretary of State to me.”</a> A letter arrived on 16 April 1817 from the president, officially offering the post to JQA. He wrote the next day to accept. On 15 May the family sailed for the United States aboard the ship Washington, landing at New York on 6 August. The journey was completed when JQA arrived at Quincy <a href="/publications/jqadiaries/index.php/document/jqadiaries-v30-1817-08-18-p237">“and had the inexpressible happiness of finding my dear and venerable father and mother in perfect health.”</a></p>
