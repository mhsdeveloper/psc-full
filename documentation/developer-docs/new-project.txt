#Adding a new edition

-add them to the db: psccore.projects with a mysql insert statement such as:

	INSERT INTO projects SET name="Papers of Joe Smith";

-add them the /html/publications/projects/projects.json; adjust any other properties there, including the id which will be assigned by MYSQL in the previous step. You can query MYSQL to find the id:

	SELECT id FROM projects WHERE name="Papers of Joe Smith";

-add create a folder for the project in /html/publications/projects. It should be the lowercase edition abbreviation, "pjs" in our example here.

-adjust their environment.php file:
	- set project_id from the id in mysql psccore.projects
	- make sure the project short name is the same as the folder name

-make sure the folowing folders are owned by www-data
	[projectdir]/includes
	[projectdir]/xml
	[projectdir]/solrtemp 
	[projectdir]/support-files

the projects/[project shortname]/customize folder needs:
	name-metadata-template.html
	metadata.json

the support-files folder needs a standard footer.html file with the name, (c), and Mellon and NHPRC logos.
