#Display Customizations For Individual Projects


##About WordPress Themes and Styles

It is not possible for individual editions to change their WordPress themes. This is because of the particular way in which the Coop publishing software integrates with WordPress. The original intention was to very loosly integrate (refered to as "loose coupling") in order to make it possible to use the software without WordPress.

Most of the style and layout options in WordPress's block editor are not compatible with the Coop theme, but there are some options available for individualizing the presentation.

##CSS styling

Projects can upload a css file for simple css overrides. Use the Support Files Manager, found on the WordPress dashboard, to upload a style.css file.


##Template Views

This options is geared toward developers with clear understanding of PHP.

If a project's folder has a "template" folder, the main router will look for view php files and use any it finds there.
