# Link Formats for Automatically Generated Pages

## Person page

Use the following URL format to link to the automatic page for a person:

	/publications/[project abbreviation]/explore/person/[HUSC]

Where [project abbreviation] is lower case, such as "jqa", and [HUSC] is the unique id for the person, such as "adams-john10"

To see a generic view outside of specific project, use "coop" as the project abbreviation.

Here is a complete example of how the html should look:

	<a href="/publications/jqa/explore/person/adams-john10">John Adams</a>
